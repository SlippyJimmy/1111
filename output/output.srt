think

483
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
so

484
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,000
probably

496
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
need

497
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,000

00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
actually

861
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,000
see

862
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,000
it

863
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and

864
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
index

865
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,000
it

866
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
for

867
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,000
other

00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,000
people

869
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
so

870
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000
if

871
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000
you

872
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
false

874
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
then

875
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000
it's

876
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000
a

group

879
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
so

880
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,000
if

881
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,000
you

882
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,000
don't

883
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,000
want

884
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
it

885
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,000
to

886
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,000
be

887
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
listable

888
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
which

889
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
will

890
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
discuss

891
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
listing

892
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
in

893
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
a

894
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
little

895
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,000
bit

896
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
but

897
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,000
it

898
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,000
allows

899
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,000
you

900
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
to

901
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
basically

902
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
say

903
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
is

904
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,000
this

905
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,000
a

906
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,000

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
group

908
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
so

909
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm

910
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
gonna

911
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000

true

913
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
because

914
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,000
it

915
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,000
makes

916
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
sense

917
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,000
to

918
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,000
have

919
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,000

922
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and

923
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
then

924
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
you

925
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
can

926
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
have

927
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,000

932
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,000
now

933
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
once

934
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,000
this

935
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
is

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,000

it

941
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
so

942
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
make

943
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
we'll

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,000
we'll

1233
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,000

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
it's

1699
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,000
using

1700
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
actually

1701
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,000
it's

1702
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,000
right

1703
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
here

1704
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
JJRB

1705
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
right

1706
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,000
here

1707
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
so

1708
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm

1709
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,000
not

1710
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,000
sure

1711
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
why

1712
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,000
it

1713
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,000
used

1714
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,000
this

1715
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
specific

1716
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,000
one

1717
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
unless

1718
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I

1719
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
logged

1720
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,000
in

1721
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
and

1722
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,000
created

1723
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
it

1724
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,000
with

1725
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,000
device

1726
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
authentication

1727
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
which

1728
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,000
is

1729
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,000
possible

1730
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
but

1731
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,000
that's

1732
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
okay

1733
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,000
we'll

1734
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,000
figure

1735
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
that

1736
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,000
out

1737
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,000
in

1738
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,000
a

1739
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,000
minute

1740
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
but

1741
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,000
that's

1742
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
basically

1743
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,000
how

1744
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,000
we

1745
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
create

1746
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,000
a

1747
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,000
group

1748
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
now

1749
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
you

1750
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
can

1751
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
see

1752
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
we

1753
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
also

1754
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
printed

1755
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,000
out

1756
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
a

1757
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,000
group

1758
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,000
as

1759
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,000
well

1760
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
so

1761
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
you

1762
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
can

1763
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
see

1764
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
here

1765
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
we

1766
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,000
have

1767
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,000
our

1768
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000

1769
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,000

1770
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
which

1771
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,000
is

1772
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,000
right

1773
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
here

1774
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,000
the

1775
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,000

1776
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000

1777
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,000

DB

1779
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
so

1780
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,000
this

1781
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,000
is

1782
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,000

ID

1785
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
so

1786
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,000
our

1787
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000

1788
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,000

JJ

1790
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
so

1791
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,000
we

1792
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,000
must

1793
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
have

1794
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
logged

1795
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,000
in

1796
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,000
with

1797
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,000
device

1798
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
authentication

1799
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
which

1800
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,000
means

1801
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I

1802
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
probably

1803
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,000
didn't

1804
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
reset

1805
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,000
my

1806
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
client's

1807
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,000
authentication

1808
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
stuff

1809
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
so

1810
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,000
let

1811
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,000
me

1812
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,000
take

1813
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,000
a

1814
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,000
look

1815
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
at

1816
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,000
that

1817
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,000
real

1818
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,000
quick

1819
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,000
my

1820
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
apologies

1821
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I

1822
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
may

1823
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
not

1824
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,000
have

1825
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,000
reset

1826
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
some

1827
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,000
of

1828
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,000
my

1829
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,000
code

1830
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
so

1831
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,000
that

1832
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,000
it

1833
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,000
worked

1834
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
properly

1835
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
did

1836
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
user

1837
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,000
authentication

1838
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
instead

1839
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
of

1840
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
our

1841
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
device

1842
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,000
authentication

1843
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
so

1844
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,000
my

1845
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,000
guess

1846
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,000
is

1847
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
that's

1848
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000
probably

1849
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000
what

1850
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000
it

1851
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000
is

1852
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
so

1853
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,000
if

1854
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I

1855
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,000
go

1856
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,000

1858
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
yeah

1859
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,000
right

1860
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,000
here

1861
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm

1862
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,000
doing

1863
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,000

1867
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
right

1868
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,000
here

1869
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and

1870
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm

1871
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000

that's

1879
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,000

we

wrong

that's

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000
okay

is

2298
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
technically

that

2305
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,000
we

here

we

got

2314
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,000
a

my

2321
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
guess

2322
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,000
is

2323
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000

00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,000
good

2363
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,000
though

2364
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
is

2365
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,000
that

2366
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,000
if

2367
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
you

2368
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,000
just

2369
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,000
change

00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,000
in

2373
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,000
here

2374
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,000
you

2375
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,000
can

2376
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,000
just

2377
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
click

2378
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,000
that

2379
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and

2380
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,000
you

2381
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,000
can

2382
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
see

2383
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,000
that

2384
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,000
it

2385
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
should

2386
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,000
work

2387
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
and

2388
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,000
that's

2389
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,000
because

2390
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
good

2391
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,000
though

2392
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,000
is

2393
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000

language

2397
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,000
so

2398
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
you

2399
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,000
can

2400
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,000
actually

2401
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,000
get

2403
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,000
with

2404
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
changing

2405
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,000
it

2406
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000

so

2412
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,000
now

2413
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
if

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,000
better

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
now

2637
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,000
we'll

2638
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,000
pull

2639
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000

allow

2644
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,000
ourselves

2645
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
to

2646
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,000
actually

2647
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
you

2648
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,000
know

2649
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
go

2650
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,000
from

2651
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,000
there

2652
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
and

2653
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
this

2654
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,000
should

2655
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,000
probably

2656
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
be

2657
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,000

2660
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,000
so

2661
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
it'll

2662
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,000
be

2663
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
fine

2664
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I

2665
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,000
guess

2666
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,000
for

2667
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
now

2668
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,000
but

2669
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,000
it's

2670
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,000
just

2671
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,000
something

2672
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm

2673
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,000
not

of

2678
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
but

2679
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,000
that's

2680
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,000
okay

2681
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
so

2682
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,000
we'll

2683
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,000

is

3173
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,000

3179
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
let's

3180
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,000
grab

3181
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
this

3182
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,000
make

3183
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,000
it

3184
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
slightly

3185
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,000
bigger

3186
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,000
again

3187
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
the

3189
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,000
section

3190
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,000
is

3191
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
going

3192
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,000
to

3193
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,000
be

3194
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,000
very

3195
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,000
large

3196
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000

3197
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,000
this

3198
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,000
so

3199
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
we'll

3200
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,000
add

3201
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000

3202
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,000

3206
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,000
like

3207
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,000
so

3208
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
and

3209
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,000
we'll

3210
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,000
call

3211
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
it

3212
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,000
open

3213
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000

that

3215
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,000
and

3216
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,000
then

3217
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,000
we're

3218
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,000
going

3219
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,000

3224
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,000
switch

3225
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,000
so

3226
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'll

3227
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
just

3228
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,000
put

3229
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,000
this

3230
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
right

3231
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,000

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,000
right

3234
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
now

3235
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,000
we'll

3236
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,000

open

3239
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,000
that's

3240
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
fine

3241
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,000
and

3242
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,000
then

3243
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
we'll

3244
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,000

3247
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
say

3248

3252
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I

3253
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,000

3264
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,000
basically

3265
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
when

00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,000

we'll

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,000

so

3372
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,000
we'll

you'll

3394
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,000

how

3458
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
you

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
that's

00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,000

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,000
we

you

3516
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,000

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
so

3866
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'll

3869
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,000
guy

3870
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,000

here

3872
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
like

3873
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
this

3874
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
and

3875
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I

3876
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,000
will

00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,000
make

3878
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
an

I

3884
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
guess

3885
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,000
it'd

3886
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,000
be

3887
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,000
a

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,000

container

3891
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,000
like

3892
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,000
so

3893
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
and

3894
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I'll

3895
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,000
make

3896
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,000
that

3897
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
full

3898
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,000
rect

3899
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,000
so

3900
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
that

3901
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,000
way

3902
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,000
it

3903
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
maximizes

3904
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,000

3907
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,000
now

3908
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
granted

3909
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,000

00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,000
sometimes

4413
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
if

4414
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,000
you

4415
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,000
have

4416
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,000
a

4417
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
group

4418
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,000
like

4419
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,000
a

4420
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
guild

4421
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,000
and

4422
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,000
you

4423
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,000
don't

4424
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,000
want

4425
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
people

4426
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,000
to

4427
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,000
see

4428
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,000
your

4429
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
guild

4430
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,000
you

4431
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,000
probably

4432
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
should

4433
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,000
make

4434
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,000
sure

4435
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
that

4436
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,000
that

4437
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,000
is

4438
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
false

4439
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
or

4440
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
true

4441
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
depending

4442
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,000
on

4443
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
your

4444
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,000
use

4445
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,000
case

4446
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
so

4447
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I'll

4448
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,000
make

4449
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
it

4450
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,000
true

4451
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,000
and

4452
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,000
that's

4453
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
pretty

4454
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,000
much

4455
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,000
everything

4456
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
that

4457
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,000
you

4458
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,000
need

4459
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,000
to

4460
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,000
know

4461
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
here

4462
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,000
now

4463
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
with

4464
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,000
this

4465
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,000
we

4466
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
should

4467
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,000
be

4468
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
relatively

4469
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,000
good

4470
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,000
to

4471
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
go

4472
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,000
so

4473
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,000
now

4474
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,000
we

4475
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,000
can

4476
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
basically

4477
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,000

that

4492
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
and

4493
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
then

you

4506
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000

we

4555
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,000
so

4556
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,000
we

4557
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,000
can

4558
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,000

00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
strong

4560
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000

4564
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
it

4565
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,000
should

00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,000
it's

4570
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,000
not

4571
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
happy

4572
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,000
so

4573
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
that's

4574
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,000
not

4575
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,000
a

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
strong

4583
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
that's

4584
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
fine

4585
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,000
not

4586
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,000

00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
one

4593
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,000
from

4594
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
into

4596
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I

4597
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
wonder

4598
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,000
if

4599
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,000
it's

4600
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
mad

4601
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,000
because

4602
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
our

4603
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
isn't

int

4606
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I

4607
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,000
think

4608
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,000
there's

4609
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,000
an

4610
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
issue

4611
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,000
here

4612
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
with

4613
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,000
how

4614
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,000
they

4615
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,000
have

4616
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
their

4617
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,000
stuff

4618
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,000
set

4619
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,000
up

4620
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
so

4621
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,000
what

4622
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,000
if

4623
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000

instead

4632
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,000
so

4633
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,000
if

4634
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,000

null

4639
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,000
see

4642
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,000

4643
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,000
that

4644
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
fixes

4645
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,000
the

4646
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
problem

4647
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
so

4648
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,000
come

4649
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,000

4651
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,000
we'll

4652

4655
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,000
it's

4656
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
still

4657
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,000
mad

4658
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
oh

4659
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,000
that's

4660
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,000
because

4661
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I

4662
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,000

4666
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
that's

4667
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,000
fair

4668
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
that's

4669
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,000
understandable

4670
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,000

what

4830
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
happens

4831
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
if

4832
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I

4833
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
do

4834
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
capital

4835
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,000
S

4836
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,000
it's

4837
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
probably

4838
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,000
capital

4839
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,000
case

4840
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
sensitive

4841
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,000
so

4842
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
we'll

4843
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,000
come

4844
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,000
in

4845
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
here

4846
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,000
and

4847
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,000
we'll

4848
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
take

4849
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,000
a

4850
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,000
look

4851
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,000
at

4852
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
our

4853
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,000
result

4854
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
still

4855
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,000
got

4856
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
nothing

4857
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,000
back

4858
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
so

4859
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
we'll

4860
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,000
continue

4861
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
through

4862
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,000
what

4863
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,000
happens

4864
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
if

4865
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I

4866
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
do

4867
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,000
a

4868
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
percent

4869
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
sign

4870
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,000
and

4871
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,000
see

4872
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,000
if

4873
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
that

4874
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,000
gives

4875
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,000
us

4876
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
something

4877
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,000
back

4878
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,000
now

4879
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
because

4880
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,000
it

4881
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
might

4882
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,000
be

4883
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,000
that

4884
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
it

4885
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,000
needs

4886
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,000
to

4887
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,000
be

4888
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,000
a

4889
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
query

4890
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,000
of

4891
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,000
some

4892
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
description

4893
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,000
so

4894
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,000
we

4895
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,000
can

4896
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
check

4897
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,000
that

4898
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
out

4899
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,000
real

4900
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,000
quick

4901
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
yep

4902
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,000
there

4903
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,000
needs

4904
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,000
to

4905
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,000
be

4906
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,000
a

4907
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
query

4908
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,000
so

4909
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,000
you

4910
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,000
can

4911
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,000
see

4912
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
it

4913
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,000
pulled

4914
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,000
back

4915
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,000
the

4916
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,000
one

4917
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
that

4918
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,000
we're

4919
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,000
looking

4920
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,000
for

4921
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,000
so

4922
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I'll

4923
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,000
pull

4924
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,000
back

4925
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,000
our

4926
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,000
group

4927
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
so

4928
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,000
when

4929
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,000
you

4930
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
do

4931
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,000
a

4932
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,000
text

4933
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
just

4934
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,000
be

4935
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,000
aware

4936
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
of

4937
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,000
that

4938
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,000
you're

4939
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,000
going

4940
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,000
to

4941
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,000
need

4942
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,000
to

4943
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
make

4944
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,000
it

4945
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,000
into

4946
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,000
an

4947
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,000
actual

4948
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
query

4949
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
instead

4950
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
so

4951
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,000
you

4952
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,000
need

4953
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,000
to

4954
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,000
add

4955
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,000
that

4956
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
percent

4957
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,000
sign

4958
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,000
at

4959
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
the

4960
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,000
end

4961
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,000
so

4962
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
that's

4963
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,000
just

4964
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,000
something

4965
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,000
to

4966
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,000
keep

4967
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
in

4968
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,000
mind

4969
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
now

4970
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
you'll

4971
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,000
see

4972
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,000
when

4973
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I

4974
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,000
hit

4975
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,000
play

4976
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
it's

4977
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,000
going

4978
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,000
to

4979
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
print

4980
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,000
out

4981
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
strong

4982
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,000
gamers

4983
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
right

4984
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,000
there

4985
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
so

4986
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,000
that's

4987
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
basically

4988
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,000
how

4989
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
you

4990
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,000
can

4991
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,000
list

4992
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
and

4993
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,000
filter

4994
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,000
your

4995
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
groups

4996
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
so

4997
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,000
that

4998
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,000
allows

4999
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
us

5000
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,000
to

5001
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,000
see

5002
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,000
those

5003
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
groups

5004
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
and

5005
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
hunt

5006
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,000
down

5010
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,000
if

5011
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
you

5012
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,000
look

5013
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
you

5014
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,000
can

5015
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,000
see

00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
you

5022
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,000
can

coding

5380
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,000

5381
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,000
a

00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,000
little

5387
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,000
we

5388
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,000
can

5389
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000

and

5393
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
you

5394
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,000
can

5395
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,000
see

5396
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,000
that

5397
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,000
we

5398
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,000
now

5399
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
have

there

5403
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
so

5404
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,000
that's

5405
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
something

5406
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,000
that

5407
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
we

5408
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,000
can

5409
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,000
actually

5410
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,000
do

5411
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
and

00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,000
pull

5413
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,000

5416
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
so

5417
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,000
that

5418
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,000

00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,000
be

5420
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
really

5421
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,000
useful

5422
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
for

00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,000

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
this

00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,000
way

00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,000
beyond

5824
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
what

5825
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,000
the

but

5830
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I

5831
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,000
think

00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
that

00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I

5839
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,000
figured

5840
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I

5841
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000

00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
this

you'll

00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,000
could

6084
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,000
find

6085
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,000
it

6086
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
right

6087
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,000
here

6088
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
to

6089
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
actually

6090
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
work

6091
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,000
so

6092
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
that's

6093
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,000
a

6094
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,000
way

6095
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,000
that

6096
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,000
we

6097
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,000
can

6098
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
go

6099
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,000
about

6100
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
making

6101
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,000
a

6102
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,000
group

6103
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
selection

6104
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,000
system

6105
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
relatively

6106
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,000
simple

6107
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
and

6108
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,000
that's

6109
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,000
how

6110
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
we

6111
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,000
can

6112
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,000
actually

6113
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,000
list

6114
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
our

6115
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,000
groups

6116
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
as

6117
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,000
well

6118
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
so

6119
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I

6120
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,000
know

6121
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,000
that's

6122
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,000
kind

6123
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,000
of

6124
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
a

6125
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,000
complicated

6126
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
way

6127
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,000
to

6128
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,000
show

6129
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,000
it

6130
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
but

6131
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I

6132
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,000
figured

6133
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,000
that

6134
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
it

6135
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,000
was

6136
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,000
an

6137
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,000
interesting

6138
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
way

6139
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
to

6140
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,000
approach

6141
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,000
it

6142
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
and

6143
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I

6144
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,000
figured

6145
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,000
you

6146
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,000

6148
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
appreciate

6149
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,000
that

6150
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
so

6151
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,000
now

6152
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,000
the

6153
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,000
question

6154
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,000

00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,000
we'll

6293
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,000
come

6294
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,000
in

6295
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
here

6296
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,000
we'll

6297
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,000
say

6298
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
user

6299
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
user

6300
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
to

6301
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
manage

6302
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,000
we'll

6303
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,000
say

6304
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
and

6305
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,000
then

6306
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
we'll

6307
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,000
come

6308
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,000
in

6309
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,000
here

6310
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,000
and

6311
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
hopefully

6312
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,000
we

6313
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,000
won't

6314
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,000
run

6315
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
out

6316
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,000
of

6317
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,000
space

6318
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,000
if

6319
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,000
we

6320
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
do

6321
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,000
we'll

6322
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,000
figure

6323
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,000
something

6324
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
out

6325
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,000
but

6326
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
let's

6327
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,000
right

6328
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,000
click

6329
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,000
add

6330
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
in

6331
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,000
a

6332
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,000
child

6333
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,000
node

6334
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,000
let's

6335
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
add

6336
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,000
in

6337
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,000
a

6338
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,000
button

6339
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:17,000
we'll

6340
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,000
add

6341
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
it

6342
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,000
for

6343
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,000
a

6344
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,000
second

6345
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
with

6346
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,000
groups

6347
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
we

6348
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,000
need

6349
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,000
to

6350
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
promote

6351
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,000
demote

6352
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
kick

6353
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,000
and

6354
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
ban

6355
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
somebody

6356
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,000
and

6357
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,000
then

6358
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,000
also

6359
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
leave

6360
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,000
that

6361
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,000
group

6362
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
so

6363
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,000
we'll

6364
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,000
need

6365
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
to

6366
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,000
figure

6367
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,000
out

6368
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,000
a

6369
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,000
way

6370
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
to

6371
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,000
give

6372
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,000
ourselves

6373
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,000
a

6374
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
little

6375
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,000
bit

6376
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,000
more

6377
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,000
space

6378
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
here

6379
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,000
because

6380
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I'm

6381
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,000
running

6382
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
out

6383
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,000
so

6384
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
maybe

6385
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I

6386
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,000
can

6387
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,000
drag

6388
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,000
this

6389
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,000
guy

6390
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
up

6391
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,000
butt

6392
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,000
it

6393
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,000
up

6394
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,000
a

6395
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,000
little

6396
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
bit

6397
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,000
closer

6398
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
drag

6399
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,000
this

6400
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,000
guy

6401
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,000
down

6402
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,000
give

6403
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
ourselves

6404
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,000
a

6405
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,000
little

6406
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,000
bit

6407
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
more

6408
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,000
space

6409
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
but

6410
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,000
we

6411
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,000
can

6412
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
promote

6413
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000

6415
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
demote

6416
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,000
and

6417
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
then

6418
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I

6419
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,000
believe

6420
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
we

6421
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,000
would

6422
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,000
need

6423
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,000

6426
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
and

6427
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,000
then

6428
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
finally

6429
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,000
the

6430
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,000

6432
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,000
that

6433
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,000
we

6434
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,000
need

6435
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,000
to

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
do

6437
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,000
is

6444
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
leave

6445
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
so

6446
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,000
we

6447
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,000
can

6448
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,000
just

6450
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
over

6451
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
goodness

6452
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,000
we're

6453
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,000
running

6458
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,000
we

6459
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,000
have

6460
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,000

6464
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,000
it's

6465
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,000
actually

6466
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
hard

6467
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,000

6471
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
so

6472
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,000
we'll

6473
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,000

00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,000
give

there

6496
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,000
we

6497
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,000
go

6498
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
we

6764
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,000
they

6765
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,000

6770
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I'm

6771
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,000
not

00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
really

6773
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,000
sure

6774
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,000
why

6775
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,000
they

6776
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000

that's

thing

6782
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,000
so

6783
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,000
it's

6784
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,000
just

6785
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,000

now

6791
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
what

6792
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,000
we

6793
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,000

6795
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,000
is

6796
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,000

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
a

6806
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,000

we'll

6834
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,000

6923
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,000
so

6924
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,000

6925
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,000

case

6927
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
that's

6928
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,000
going

6929
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,000
to

I

6939
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,000
believe

6940
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,000
it's

6941
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000

6945
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,000
let

6946
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,000
me

6947
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,000
double

6948
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
check

6949
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,000
really

6950
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
quick

6951
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,000
because

6952
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
sometimes

6953
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I

6954
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:19,000
forget

6955
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
things

6956
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,000
it

6957
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
is

6958
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:21,000
and

6959
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
then

6960
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,000
we

6961
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,000
have

6962
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,000

6963
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,000

6968
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
so

6969
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,000
that's

6970
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,000
going

6971
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,000

00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
it's

7059
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,000
we

it's

00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,000

7756
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
well

7757
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:16,000
we're

7758
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:16,000

00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
so

7767
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,000
let's

7768
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
duplicate

7769
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,000

we'll

just

7774
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:20,000

7778
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I

7779
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,000
guess

7780
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,000
we're

7781
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000

00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I'll

also

9695
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000

I

9711
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000

01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:16,000
this

9713
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:16,000

01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:17,000
if

9718
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I

and

9723
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:18,000
we

9724
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000

I'm

9735
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
curious

9736
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
if

9737
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:23,000
we

9738
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:23,000

make

01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:25,000
it

9741
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
follow

01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
the

9743
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
actual

01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
scrolling

9745
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:29,000
but

9746
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I

9747
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:29,000
don't

9748
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
think

9749
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:30,000
we

9750
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
can

9751
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I

9752
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:31,000
know

9753
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:31,000
there's

9754
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
a

9755
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:32,000
way

9756
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:32,000

01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:32,000
it

9759
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:32,000
it's

9760
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
been

9761
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:33,000
a

9762
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:33,000
while

9763
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:33,000
since

9764
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:33,000
I've

9765
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
done

9766
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000

9767
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I

9768
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:35,000
think

9769
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I'll

9770
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:35,000
just

9771
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:35,000
go

9772
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
ahead

9773
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:36,000
and

9774
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:36,000
skip

9775
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
that

9776
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:37,000
part

9777
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:37,000
but

9778
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:37,000
there

9779
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:37,000
is

9780
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:37,000
a

9781
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
way

9782
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,000
to

9783
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,000
make

9784
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,000
it

9785
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,000
so

9786
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,000
it

9787
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
automatically

bottom

9792
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:40,000

9793
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
that's

9794
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:41,000
okay

9795
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
right

9796
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:42,000
now

9797
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000

this

9799
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000

9800
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:44,000
basically

9801
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:44,000

this

01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I'm

guy

9917
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:24,000
right

9918
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
here

9919
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:25,000

01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
it

9921
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:26,000
and

9922
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
paste

9923
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:27,000
it

9924
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:27,000
it's

9925
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
not

9926
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:28,000
the

9927
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:28,000
most

9928
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:28,000
ideal

9929
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
situation

9930
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:29,000
because

9931
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:29,000
once

9932
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:29,000
you're

9933
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
connected

9934
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,000

9937
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:31,000
you

9938
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:31,000
should

9939
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:31,000
probably

9940
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
just

9941
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:32,000
be

9942
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
connected

9943
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:33,000
to

9944
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:33,000
that

9945
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
channel

9946
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:34,000
right

9947
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
instead

9948
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:35,000
of

9949
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:35,000
passing

9950
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:35,000
in

9951
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
this

9952
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:36,000
value

9953
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:36,000
here

9954
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
but

9955
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
we

9956
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:38,000
can

9957
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:38,000
basically

9958
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
throw

9959
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:39,000

9961
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000

9962
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:41,000

top

9965
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:42,000
and

9966
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:42,000
basically

9967
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
just

9968
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:43,000
save

9969
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:43,000
it

9970
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:43,000
across

9971
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
different

9973
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000

9974
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:45,000
that

9975
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:45,000
would

9976
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:45,000
solve

9977
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:45,000
this

9978
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
problem

9979
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:46,000
but

9980
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:46,000
for

9981
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:46,000
right

9982
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
now

9983
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:47,000
we'll

9984
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:47,000
go

and

9990
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:49,000
then

9991
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
we

9992
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:50,000
need

9993
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:50,000

01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
we'll

try

10863
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:50,000

that

10868
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:51,000
works

10869
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
also

10870
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I'm

10871
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:52,000
going

want

10885
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
we'll

01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:56,000

01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:05,000
this

10921
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
should

10922
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:06,000
work

10923
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
so

10924
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:07,000
we'll

10925
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:07,000

it

10941
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:16,000

01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
very

10943
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:17,000
unhappy

10944
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
so

10945
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:18,000
let's

10946
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:18,000
take

10947
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:18,000
a

10948
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:18,000
look

10949
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
you

10950
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:19,000
can

10951
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:19,000
see

10952
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
the

10953
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:20,000
content

10954
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
here

10955
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:21,000
is

10956
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
a

10957
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:22,000

10958
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
data

10959
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:23,000
so

10960
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:23,000
it

10961
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:23,000
looks

10962
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:23,000
like

10963
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
we're

10964
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:24,000
going

10965
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:24,000
to

10966
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:24,000
need

10967
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:24,000

01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Jason

10969
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:25,000
parse

10970
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:25,000
this

10971
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
information

10972
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
so

10973
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:27,000
go

10974
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000

dot

10976
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
parse

01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:29,000
string

10978
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
and

10979
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:30,000
we'll

10980
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
go

10981
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:31,000
ahead

10982
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:31,000

10983
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
pass

10984
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:32,000

10985
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:32,000
in

10986
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,000
and

10987
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:33,000
there

10988
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
we

10989
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:34,000
go

10990
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:34,000

10991
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:34,000
that

10992
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:34,000
should

10993
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:34,000
fix

10994
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
that

10995
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:35,000
problem

10996
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:36,000
basically

10997
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
content

10998
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:37,000
is

10999
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:37,000

value

11002
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
so

11003
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:39,000
that's

11004
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:39,000
something

11005
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
that

11006
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I

11007
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:40,000
didn't

11008
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:40,000
think

11009
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:40,000
about

11010
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I'm

11011
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:41,000
talking

11012
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:41,000
without

11013
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
thinking

11014
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:42,000
as

11015
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I'm

11016
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:43,000
doing

11017
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:43,000
this

11018
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:43,000
tutorial

11019
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
so

11020
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:44,000
forgive

11021
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
me

11022
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:45,000
but

11023
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
we

11024
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:46,000
need

11025
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:46,000
to

11026
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:46,000
actually

11027
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:46,000
parse

11028
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000

data

11030
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:47,000
so

11031
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:47,000
now

11032
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:47,000

11033
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000

you'll

11037
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:49,000
see

11043
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000

that's

01:09:59,000 --> 01:09:59,000
basically

11058
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
how

11059
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
you

11060
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000

is

11269
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
you

11270
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:15,000
need

11271
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:15,000

01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:15,000
in

11274
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:15,000

11279
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:17,000
so

11280
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
go

11281
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:18,000

then

11289
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:20,000
we

11290
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:20,000

01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
basically

11296
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:22,000
just

01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
right

11302
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:25,000

11303
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:25,000
it's

11304
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:25,000
almost

11305
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
a

11306
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:26,000

11307
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:26,000
right

11308
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
it's

11309
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:27,000

01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:28,000
we'll

11314
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
just

there

11320
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
and

really

11324
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:32,000
need

01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:32,000
to

11326
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
do

11327
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000

here

11331
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
and

11332
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:37,000
when

11333
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000

we

11340
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:42,000
just

11341
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:42,000
basically

11342
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:42,000
need

01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:42,000

believe

and

11653
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
why

11654
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:32,000
it's

11676
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:39,000
be

11677
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:39,000
able

11678
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:39,000
to

11679
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
pull

11680
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:40,000
back

11681
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:40,000
all

11682
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
of

11683
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:41,000
that

11684
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:41,000
information

11685
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
so

11686
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:42,000
the

11687
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
reason

11688
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:43,000
why

11689
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:43,000
that's

11690
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:43,000
cool

11691
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
is

11692
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:44,000
because

11693
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
we

11694
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:45,000
can

11695
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:45,000

11698
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:46,000
and

11699
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:46,000
we

11700
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
can

11701
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:47,000
say

11702
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:47,000
okay

11703
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
when

11704
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:48,000
the

01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000

11710
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
will

11711
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:51,000
have

11712
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:51,000

and

11720
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
we'll

11721
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:55,000
need

11722
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:55,000

11734
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:00,000
so

11735
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
we'll

11736
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:01,000

we

11773
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:23,000

11777
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
we'll

11778
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:24,000
just

11779
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:24,000
do

11780
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:24,000
100

11781
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:24,000
that's

11782
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
a

11783
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:25,000
very

11784
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:25,000
decent

01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
forward

11787
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
basically

11788
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:28,000
forward

11789
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000

11790
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:29,000
forward

11791
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:29,000
or

11792
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
backwards

11793
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:30,000
right

11794
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:30,000
so

11795
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:30,000
we

11796
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:30,000
can

11797
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:30,000
grab

11798
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
the

oldest

11800
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:31,000
or

11801
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:31,000
the

11802
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:31,000
newest

11803
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
and

11804
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:32,000
that's

11805
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:32,000
what

11806
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:32,000
forward

11807
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
is

11808
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:33,000
as

11809
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:33,000
forward

11810
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:33,000
as

11811
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:33,000
the

11812
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
newest

11813
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:34,000
so

11814
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
we'll

11815
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:35,000
say

11816
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:35,000
forward

11817
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
so

11818
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:37,000
we'll

11819
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:37,000
say

01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000

11823
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
then

11824
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:40,000
I

11825
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000

they

11827
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:41,000

01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:46,000
it's

11879
01:14:59,000 --> 01:14:59,000
say

11880
01:14:59,000 --> 01:14:59,000
you

11881
01:14:59,000 --> 01:14:59,000
have

11882
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
500

11883
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:00,000
messages

11884
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
you

11885
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:01,000
can

11886
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:01,000
pass

11887
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
in

11888
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
number

11889
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:03,000
200

11890
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
and

11891
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:04,000
that

11892
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:04,000
it'll

11893
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:04,000
grab

11894
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
from

11895
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:05,000
200

11896
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:05,000
to

11897
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
300

11898
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:06,000
if

11899
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:06,000
that

11900
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:06,000
makes

11901
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
sense

11902
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:07,000
so

11903
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
in

11904
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:08,000
our

11905
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:08,000
case

11906
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I'll

11907
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:08,000
just

11908
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:08,000
leave

11909
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
that

11910
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:09,000
as

11911
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:09,000
null

11912
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
because

11913
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:10,000
it's

11914
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:10,000
just

11915
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:10,000
going

11916
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:10,000
to

11917
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,000
be

11918
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:11,000
easier

11919
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:11,000
for

11920
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:11,000
us

11921
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:11,000
to

11922
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:11,000
work

11923
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
with

11924
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:12,000
it

11925
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
and

11926
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:13,000
now

11927
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:13,000
we

11928
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:13,000
can

11929
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:13,000
go

11930
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
for

11931
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
message

11932
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000

11935
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
like

11936
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:19,000
that

11937
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
messages

11938
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
like

11939
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
that

11940
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:23,000
and

11941
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
then

11942
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:24,000
we

11943
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:24,000
can

11944
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
basically

11945
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
just

11946
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:26,000
go

11947
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
exactly

11948
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
what

11949
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:28,000
we

11950
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:28,000
did

11951
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
before

11952
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:29,000
so

11953
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:29,000
we

11954
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:29,000
can

11955
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:29,000
come

11956
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
up

11957
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:30,000
here

11958
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:30,000
and

11959
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
grab

11960
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:31,000
if

11961
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:31,000
you

11962
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
remember

11963
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:32,000
how

11964
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:32,000
we

11965
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
actually

11966
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:33,000
parsed

11967
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
out

11968
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:34,000
our

11969
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
data

11970
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
which

11971
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:36,000
arguably

11972
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:36,000
I

11973
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:36,000
should

11974
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
move

11975
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:37,000
this

11976
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:37,000
down

11977
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
closer

11978
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
to

11979
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:39,000
my

11980
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:39,000

functionality

11983
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
so

11984
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:41,000
let's

11985
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:41,000
go

11986
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:41,000
ahead

11987
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:41,000
and

11988
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:41,000
just

11989
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
do

11990
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:42,000
that

11991
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:42,000
really

11992
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:42,000
quick

11993
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
we'll

11994
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:43,000
come

11995
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
down

11996
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:44,000
here

11997
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
and

11998
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:45,000
just

11999
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
drop

12000
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:46,000
it

12001
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
right

12002
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
let's

12003
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:48,000
see

12004
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:48,000
this

12005
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
is

12006
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:49,000
group

12007
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:49,000
stuff

12008
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
this

12009
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
is

12010
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:51,000
chat

12011
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:51,000
stuff

12012
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
so

12013
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,000
we'll

12014
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,000
go

12015
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,000
ahead

12016
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,000
and

12017
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,000
just

12018
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
drop

12019
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:53,000
it

12020
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:53,000
right

12021
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:53,000
there

12022
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
and

12023
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:54,000
that'll

12024
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:54,000
just

12025
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:54,000
kind

12026
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
of

12027
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:55,000
keep

12028
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:55,000
it

12029
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
within

12030
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:56,000

12031
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000

12032
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:57,000
area

12033
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:57,000
so

12034
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:57,000
that

12035
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
way

12036
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:58,000
I

12037
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:58,000
can

12038
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000

12040
01:15:59,000 --> 01:15:59,000

12043
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:00,000
do

12044
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
this

12045
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:01,000
and

12046
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:01,000

12050
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
right

12051
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:05,000
here

12052
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:05,000
and

12053
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:05,000
that

12054
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
will

01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
actually

01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:08,000
we

12066
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
could

01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:09,000
do

12068
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:09,000
is

we

12070
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:09,000
could

copy

12076
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000

01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:15,000
we

12083
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:15,000
need

01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:15,000

12087
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:16,000

01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:17,000
this

12091
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000

work

12094
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000

12095
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:19,000
now

12096
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:19,000

01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:19,000

exist

12332
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,000
so

12333
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:12,000
that's

12334
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:12,000
not

12335
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
great

12336
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:13,000
so

12337
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:13,000
that

12338
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
means

12339
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:14,000
something

12340
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:14,000

with

12343
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:15,000
how

12344
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:15,000
we

12345
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000

I

12350
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:17,000
think

12351
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
okay

12352
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:18,000
so

12353
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I

12354
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000

to

01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:38,000
reusable

12584
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
later

12585
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
that's

12586
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:40,000
one

12587
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:40,000

12593
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
so

12594
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:43,000
now

12595
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:43,000
the

12596
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
question

12597

is

12598
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:44,000
okay

12599
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
so

12600
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:45,000

12609
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
it's

12610
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:49,000
not

12611
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:49,000

but

12616
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000

01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:41,000
we

12898
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:41,000
take

12899
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:41,000

12901
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000

interface

12905
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:43,000
we

12906
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:43,000
have

12907
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:43,000
a

12910
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:44,000
we

12911
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:44,000
could

12912
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
probably

12913
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:45,000
just

12914
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000

12916
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:46,000
I

12917
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
think

12918
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:47,000
that

12919
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:47,000

12920
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:47,000
work

12921
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
so

12922
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000

I'll

12928
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:50,000
do

12929
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
is

12930
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:51,000
I'll

12931
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:51,000

12939
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
so

12940
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:54,000
we'll

12941
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000

01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:56,000
hit

12947
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000

12953
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
and

12954
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:02,000
then

12955
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:02,000
that

12956
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:02,000

12961
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
so

12962
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:05,000
now

12963
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:05,000
we

12964
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:05,000
know

12965
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
that's

12966
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:06,000
going

12967
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:06,000
to

12968
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:06,000

12972
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:07,000

that's

12974
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:08,000
it

12975
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:08,000
so

12976
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:08,000
since

12977
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
it's

12978
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:09,000
going

12979
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:09,000
to

01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:09,000

can

12986
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
basically

12987
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:12,000
just

12988
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:12,000
do

12989
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000

01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
greater

12995
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:20,000

12997
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000

12998
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:22,000
we

12999
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
can

13000
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:23,000

and

13010
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:25,000
then

13011
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
we

13012
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:26,000
can

01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:26,000
just

that'll

we

13033
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:34,000
can

13034
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
actually

13035
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:35,000
communicate

13036
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:35,000
with

13037
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
so

13038
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:36,000

this

01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
should

13043
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:38,000
work

13044
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:38,000

01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:39,000
always

but

13056
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:41,000
we'll

13057
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:41,000
see

13058
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
so

13059
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:42,000
we'll

13060
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,000
submit

test

13063
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
we'll

13064
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:44,000
submit

13065
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:44,000

01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
and

13069
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:46,000
then

13070
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:46,000
we'll

13071
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
go

13072
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:47,000
test

13073
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000

01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
join

13075
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:49,000
direct

13076
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
chat

13077
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
it's

13078
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:51,000
mad

13079
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
and

13080
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:52,000
that's

13081
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:52,000
because

13082
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
users

13083
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
came

13084
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
back

13085
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:55,000
let's

13086
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
see

13087
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000

13088
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:57,000
array

13089
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
it

13090
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:58,000
looks

13091
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:58,000
like

13092
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:58,000
it's

so

13097
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:00,000
that's

13098
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:00,000

01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:01,000

we

okay

13209
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:52,000
so

13210
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
I

13211
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:53,000
think

13212
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:53,000
I

13213
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:53,000
figured

13214
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:53,000
out

13215
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:53,000
what's

13216
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:53,000
going

13217
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
on

13218
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:54,000
here

13219
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:54,000
so

13220
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:54,000
I

13221
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
commented

13222
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:55,000
this

13223
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:55,000
out

13224
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
just

13225
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:56,000
so

13226
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:56,000
we

13227
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:56,000
could

13228
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:56,000
check

13229
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:56,000
it

13230
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
out

13231
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:57,000
but

13232
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:57,000
I

13233
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:57,000
think

13234
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
is

13235
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:58,000
going

13236
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
on

13237
01:23:59,000 --> 01:23:59,000
here

13238
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
is

13239
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
remember

13240
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
in

13241
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:02,000
our

13242
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
previous

13243
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
tutorial

13244
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:04,000
we

13245
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
had

13246
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
test

13247
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:07,000

13248
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
test

13249
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:09,000
two

13250
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
and

13251
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:10,000
because

13252
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
they're

13253
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:11,000
blocked

13254
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,000
they

13255
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:12,000
can't

13256
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:12,000
send

13257
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:12,000
them

13258
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,000
messages

13259
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
so

13260
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:15,000
it

13261
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:15,000
completely

13262
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:15,000
stops

13263
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
them

13264
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:16,000
from

13265
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:16,000
being

13266
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:16,000
able

13267
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:16,000
to

13268
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
communicate

13269
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:17,000
with

13270
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:17,000
each

13271
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:17,000
other

13272
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
and

13273
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:18,000
that's

13274
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
why

13275
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:20,000
this

13276
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:20,000
is

13277
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:20,000
happening

13278
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
so

13279
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:21,000
if

13280
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:21,000
I

13281
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:21,000
remove

13282
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
this

13283
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
let's

13284
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:23,000
see

13285
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:23,000
what

13286
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
happens

13287
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:24,000
if

13288
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:24,000
I

13289
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:24,000
do

13290

that

13291
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:25,000
so

13292
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:25,000
we'll

13293
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:25,000
go

13294
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
ahead

13295
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:26,000
and

13296
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:26,000
come

13297
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:26,000

13298
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:26,000
here

13299
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
we'll

13300
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:27,000
control

13301
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
S

13302
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:28,000
will

13303

13306
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:30,000
then

13307
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:30,000
we'll

13308
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000

so

13314
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:32,000
we'll

we

13331
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:41,000
will

01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000

01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:43,000
that

13337
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:43,000
will

13338
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
now

13339
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:44,000
work

13340
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
now

13341
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:45,000
the

13342
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
reason

13343
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:46,000
why

13344
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
this

13345
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:47,000
did

13346
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:47,000
it

13347
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:47,000
work

13348
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
was

13349
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:48,000
because

13350
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
test

13351
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:49,000
had

13352
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
test

13353
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:50,000
to

13354
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:50,000
block

13355
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
so

13356
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:51,000
since

13357
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:51,000
they're

13358
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:51,000
blocked

13359
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
they

13360
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:52,000
can't

13361
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:52,000
communicate

13362
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
at

13363
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:53,000
all

13364
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
so

13365
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:54,000
that's

13366
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:54,000
the

13367
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:54,000
reason

13368
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,000
why

13369
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:55,000
this

13370
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
happened

13371
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:57,000
so

13372
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
it

13373
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:58,000
was

13374
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:58,000
my

13375
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
fault

13376
01:24:59,000 --> 01:24:59,000
but

13377
01:24:59,000 --> 01:24:59,000
that

13378
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
was

13379
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:00,000
basically

13380
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:00,000
the

13381
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
reasoning

13382
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:01,000
now

13383
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:01,000
if

13384
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:01,000
we

13385
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,000
go

13386
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:02,000
ahead

13387
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
and

13388
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:03,000
stop

13389
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
this

13390
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
and

13391
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:05,000
then

13392
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:05,000
we

13393
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:05,000
come

13394
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:05,000
in

13395
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
here

13396
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:06,000
and

13397
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
uncomment

13398
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:07,000
this

13399
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
with

13400
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:08,000
control

13401
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:08,000
okay

13402
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
and

13403
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
then

13404
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:10,000
we

13405
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:10,000
run

13406
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
this

13407
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:11,000
bad

13408
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:11,000
boy

13409
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
in

13410
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:12,000
theory

13411
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:12,000
we

13412
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
should

13413
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:13,000
be

13414
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:13,000
able

13415
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:13,000

13416
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:13,000

13417
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:13,000

13420
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:15,000
so

13421
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
test

13422
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:16,000
to

you

13429
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:19,000
will

01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:21,000
I'm

mostly

13445
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:24,000
because

13446
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
of

13447
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:25,000
my

testing

13449
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:26,000
not

13450
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
because

13451
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:27,000
of

01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
a

01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Nakama

13456
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:29,000
that's

13457
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:29,000
just

13458
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
something

13459
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:30,000

13460
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:30,000
I

13461
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:30,000
did

13462
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
on

13466
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
accident

13467
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
but

13468
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:33,000
you

13469
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:33,000

you

I'll

14090
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:43,000
probably

14091
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,000

but

14096
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:46,000
it's

14097
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:46,000
a

14098
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:46,000

bit

14107
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
more

14108
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
useful

14109
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000

sense

14113
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000

14114
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
if

14115
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:55,000

01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,000
this

14731
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:04,000
we'll

14732
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:04,000
just

14733
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
return

14734
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,000

value

14736
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
so

14737
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:07,000
we'll

14738
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:07,000
just

14739
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000

oh

14743
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:10,000
I

14744
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
guess

14745
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:11,000
I'm

14746
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:11,000
going

14747
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:11,000

14753
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:12,000
so

14754
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
var

14755
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,000

then

14762
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:16,000
we'll

this

14793
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
when

we

14807
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:38,000
could

01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
just

14809
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:39,000

panel

14817
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:42,000
like

14818
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:42,000
we're

14819
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:42,000
doing

14820
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
right

14821
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:43,000
here

14822
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:43,000
you

14823
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:43,000
can

14824
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:43,000
see

14825
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:43,000
how

14826
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:43,000
we're

14827
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,000
joining

14828
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:44,000

14829
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
asynchronously

14830
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:45,000
so

14831
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:45,000
we

14832
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
really

14833
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:46,000
could

14834
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:46,000
just

14835
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
grab

14836
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:47,000
this

14837
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,000
section

14838
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:50,000
here

14839
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
and

14840
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
just

14841
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:53,000
paste

14842
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:53,000
it

14843
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:53,000
right

14844
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
here

14845
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
on

14846
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:56,000
this

14847
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:56,000
guy

14848
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
like

14849
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:57,000
so

14850
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
and

14851
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:58,000
that'll

14852
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
basically

14853
01:34:59,000 --> 01:34:59,000
solve

14854
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,000
that

14855
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:00,000
problem

14856
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
right

14857
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:01,000
there

14858
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:01,000
now

14859
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
technically

14860
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:02,000
this

14861
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:02,000
is

14862
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
duplicated

14863
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:03,000
code

14864
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:03,000
and

14865
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:03,000
that's

14866
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
probably

14867
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:04,000
not

14868
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:04,000
the

14869
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:04,000
most

14870
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,000
ideal

14871
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:05,000
situation

14872
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,000
but

14873
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:06,000
that's

14874
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
probably

14875
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:07,000
okay

14876
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
for

14877
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:08,000
right

14878
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:08,000
now

14879
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
and

14880
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,000

14881
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:10,000

14932
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:32,000
maybe

we

01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,000

which

15549
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
should

15550
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:35,000
be

15551
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
I

15552
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:36,000
think

15553
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:36,000
I

15554
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:36,000
need

15555
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:36,000
to

15556
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,000
put

15557
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:37,000
it

15558
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:37,000
out

15559
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,000
inside

15560
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:38,000
the

15561
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
the

connection

15564
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:42,000
so

15565
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
I'm

15566
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:43,000
connecting

15567
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:43,000
I'm

15568
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
binding

15569
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:44,000
this

15570
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:44,000
to

15571
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
the

15573
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:45,000

01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,000
I

15579
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:47,000
think

15580
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:47,000
that's

15581
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,000
what's

15582
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:48,000
doing

15583
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:48,000
it

15584
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:48,000
so

15585
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
let's

15586
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:49,000
try

15587
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,000
that

15588
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:50,000
let's

15589
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:50,000
grab

15590
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,000
the

15591
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:51,000

15592
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:51,000
one

15593
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
so

15594
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:52,000
you

15595
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:52,000
can

15596
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:52,000
see

15597
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:52,000
how

15598
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:52,000
this

15599
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
one

15600
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:53,000
connect

15601
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
dot

15602
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,000
bind

15603
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
instead

15604
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:56,000
I

15605
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:56,000
think

15606
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:56,000
I

15607
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:56,000
need

15608
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
to

15609
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:57,000
bind

15610
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
and

15611
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:58,000
then

15612
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
do

15613
01:39:59,000 --> 01:39:59,000
that

15614
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,000
and

15615
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
then

15616
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
I

15617
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,000
should

15618
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:01,000
be

15619
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:01,000
able

15620
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,000
to

15621
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:02,000
make

15622
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:02,000
that

15623
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:02,000
work

15624
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
and

15625
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:03,000
I

15626
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:03,000
believe

15627
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:03,000
it

15628
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,000
is

15629
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
index

15630
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:06,000
and

15631
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:06,000
then

id

15634
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,000
so

15635
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:08,000
let's

15636
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:08,000
try

15637
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:08,000
that

15638
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,000
let's

15639
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:09,000
see

15640
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:09,000
what

15641
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:09,000
that

15642
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,000
does

15643
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,000
there

15644
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:11,000
we

15645
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:11,000
go

15646
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:11,000
and

15647
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,000
then

15648
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:12,000
if

15649
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:12,000
I

15650
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:12,000
click

15651
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:12,000
test

15652
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,000
to

15653
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:13,000
it

15654
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,000
should

15655
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:14,000
have

there

15661
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,000
so

15662
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:17,000
that's

15663
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:17,000
perfect

15664
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,000
so

15665
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:18,000
what

15666
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:18,000
that

15667
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,000

01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:19,000

15669
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:19,000

it

15713
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:40,000
should

just

01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
take

that's

01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
fine

15726
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:45,000
my

01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:45,000

15728
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:45,000
is

15729
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,000
that's

15730
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:46,000
because

15731
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,000

15737
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:49,000

15738
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
now

15739
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:50,000
we're

15740
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:50,000
going

15741
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:50,000

right

15745
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000

01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:52,000
we're

01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,000
that's

01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:21,000
going

15816
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:21,000
to

that

sense

15825
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
so

15826
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
I

15827
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,000
think

01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:27,000
we

15829
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,000
could

01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:28,000
probably

15831
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,000
get

15837
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:32,000
going

15838
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
to

15839
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:33,000
give

15843
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:36,000
its

here

15863
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:44,000
I

15864
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
wonder

15865
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:45,000
if

15866
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:45,000
we

15867
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:45,000
should

15868
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:45,000
pull

15869
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
because

15870
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:46,000
it

15871
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:46,000
has

15872
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:46,000
a

15873
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
user

15874
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:47,000
name

15875
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:47,000
right

15876
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:47,000
here

15877
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
but

15878
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:48,000
that's

15879
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:48,000
not

15880
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:48,000
going

15881
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:48,000
to

15882
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,000

15883
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:49,000
us

15884
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:49,000
up

15885
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:49,000
to

15886
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:49,000

code

15889
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
so

15890
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:51,000
I'm

15891
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000
curious

15892
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,000
if

15893
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:53,000
we

15894
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,000
need

15895
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:54,000
to

15896
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,000
change

15897
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:55,000
how

15898
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:55,000
we

15899
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:55,000
send

15900
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,000
our

15901
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:56,000

15902
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:56,000
across

15903
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
so

15904
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:57,000
we

15905
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
send

15906
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:58,000
our

15907
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:58,000
data

15908
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:58,000
we're

15909
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:58,000
sending

15910
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
the

01:41:59,000 --> 01:41:59,000

15912
01:41:59,000 --> 01:41:59,000
and

15913
01:41:59,000 --> 01:41:59,000
then

15914
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
the

15915
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:00,000
current

15916
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000

15917
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:01,000
id

15918
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,000
okay

15919
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:02,000
so

15920
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:02,000
I

15921
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
think

15922
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:03,000
I

15923
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:03,000
know

15924
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:03,000
what

15925
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:03,000
I'm

15926
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:03,000
going

15927
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
to

15928
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:04,000
do

15929
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:04,000
here

15930
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:04,000
so

15931
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
we're

15932
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:05,000
actually

15933
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:05,000
going

15934
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:05,000
to

15935
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:06,000
change

15936
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:06,000
up

15937
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,000
a

15938
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:07,000
little

15939
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:07,000
bit

15940
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,000
how

15941
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:08,000
we're

15942
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:08,000
doing

15943
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
this

15944
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:09,000
and

15945
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,000
the

15946
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:10,000
reason

15947
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:10,000
why

15948
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:10,000
I'll

15949
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
show

15950
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:11,000
you

15951
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
if

15952
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:12,000

01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
it's

16204
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:54,000
probably

16205
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,000

01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:17,000
we

16361
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:17,000
could

16362
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:17,000
just

16363
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:17,000

01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:22,000
that

16368
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:22,000

right

16383
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:27,000
there

16387
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:29,000
that

would

16389
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,000
work

16390
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,000
let's

16391
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:31,000
try

16392
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:31,000
that

16393
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:31,000
and

16394
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:31,000
see

16395
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,000
how

works

16398
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,000
so

16399
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,000
if

16400
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:34,000
we

this

16418
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:41,000

that's

16440
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:49,000
basically

16441
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:49,000
how

01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:53,000
actually

but

16673
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,000
just

16674
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:14,000
know

16675
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,000
that

16676
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:15,000
if

16677
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:15,000
you

16678
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:15,000
want

16679
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:15,000
to

16680
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:15,000
go

01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:15,000

16682
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,000
into

production

16684
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,000
you

16685
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:17,000
need

16686
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:17,000
to

16687
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,000
use

16688
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:18,000
your

server

16691
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,000
and

16692
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:20,000
something

16693
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:20,000
to

16694
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:20,000
keep

16695
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,000
in

16696
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:21,000
mind

16697
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,000
you

16698
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:22,000
can

16699
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,000
host

16700
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:23,000
your

16701
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:23,000
own

16702
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:23,000
server

16703
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,000
as

16704
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:24,000
well

16705
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,000
locally

16706
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:25,000
but

16707
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:25,000
it's

16708
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:26,000
a

16709
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:26,000
lot

16710
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:26,000
harder

16711
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,000
it's

16712
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:27,000
not

16713
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:27,000
as

16714
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:27,000
safe

16715
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,000
and

16716
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:28,000
people

16717
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:28,000
can

16718
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:28,000
hack

16719
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,000
into

16720
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:29,000
your

16721
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:29,000
networks

16722
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:29,000
and

16723
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:29,000
things

16724
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,000
like

16725
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:30,000
that

16726
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:30,000
so

16727
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:30,000
it's

16728
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:30,000
really

16729
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,000
nice

16730
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:31,000
just

16731
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:31,000
to

16732
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:31,000
use

16733
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,000
something

16734
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:32,000
like

16735
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:32,000
this

16736
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:32,000
to

16737
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,000
host

16738
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:33,000
it

16739
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:33,000
for

16740
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:33,000
you

16741
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,000
so

16742
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
that

16743
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:35,000
you

16744
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,000
can

16745
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:36,000
get

16746
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:36,000
your

16747
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:36,000
game

16748
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,000
out

16749
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:37,000
there

16750
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:37,000
and

16751
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:37,000
get

16752
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:37,000
people

16753
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,000
playing

16754
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:38,000
it

16755
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:38,000
and

16756
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,000
playing

16757
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:39,000
together

16758
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,000
so

16759
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:40,000
let's

16760
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,000
go

16761
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:41,000
ahead

16762
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:41,000
and

16763
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,000
create

16764
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:42,000

16766
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:42,000

lot

17005
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:00,000

but

17010
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:01,000
this

17011
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:01,000
is

17012
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:01,000
a

17013
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:01,000
good

17014
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:02,000
way

17015
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:02,000
to

17016
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:02,000
kind

17017
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:02,000
of

01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,000
into

01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:04,000
that

17022
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,000
if

17023
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:05,000
that

01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:05,000
makes

01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:05,000
sense

17026
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,000
so

17027
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:07,000
let's

17028
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:07,000
go

17029
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:07,000
ahead

17030
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,000
and

17031
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:08,000
talk

17032
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,000
about

17033
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:09,000
how

17034
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:09,000
to

17035
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:09,000
create

17036
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:09,000
a

17037
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,000
droplet

17038
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:10,000
so

17039
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:10,000
let's

17040
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:10,000
go

17041
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:10,000
up

17042
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:10,000
here

17043
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:10,000
to

17044
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:10,000
the

17045
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,000
upper

17046
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:11,000
right

17047
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:11,000
hand

17048
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:11,000
corner

17049
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:11,000
click

17050
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,000
on

17051
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:12,000
create

17052
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,000
click

17053
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:13,000
on

17054
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,000
droplet

17055
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,000
you

17056
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:15,000
could

17057
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:15,000
do

17058
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:15,000
an

17059
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:15,000
app

17060
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,000
platform

17061
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:16,000
that's

17062
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,000
technically

17063
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:17,000
going

17064
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:17,000
to

17065
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:17,000
be

17066
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,000
cheaper

17067
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:18,000
but

17068
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:18,000
it's

17069
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:18,000
a

17070
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:18,000
lot

17071
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,000
harder

17072
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:19,000
to

17073
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:19,000
get

17074
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:19,000
everything

17075
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,000
set

17076
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:20,000
up

17077
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:20,000
properly

17078
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,000
so

17079
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:21,000
I'm

17080
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:21,000
just

17081
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:21,000

01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:21,000
do

17083
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:21,000
a

17084
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,000
droplet

17085
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:22,000
for

17086
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:22,000
right

17087
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:22,000
now

17088
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:26,000
and

17089
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:26,000
so

17090
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,000
we

17091
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:27,000
can

17092
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:27,000

in

17100
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:30,000

right

17102
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:30,000

17103
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:30,000
I'm

17104
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:30,000

01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,000
can

17380
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:58,000
and

17381
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,000
plus

17382
01:50:59,000 --> 01:50:59,000
one

17383
01:50:59,000 --> 01:50:59,000
so

17384
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,000
for

17385
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:00,000
instance

17386
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:00,000
if

01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:00,000
you

17388
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:00,000
think

17389
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,000
that

17390
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:01,000
your

01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:01,000
game

17392
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,000
is

17393
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:02,000
going

17394
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:02,000
to

17395
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:02,000
be

17396
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:02,000
really

17397
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,000
small

17398
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:03,000
and

17399
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:03,000
not

17400
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:03,000
a

17401
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:03,000
lot

17402
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:03,000
of

17403
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:03,000
people

17404
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:03,000
are

17405
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:04,000
gonna

17406
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:04,000
play

17407
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:04,000
it

17408
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,000
then

17409
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:05,000
something

17410
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:05,000
like

17411
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:05,000
the

because

01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:43,000
it's

01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:51,000
I'm

17541
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:51,000
doing

01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,000
now

17548
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:56,000

01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:56,000
this

17550
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:56,000
is

17551
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,000
going

17552
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:57,000
to

I

17557
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,000
should

17558
01:51:59,000 --> 01:51:59,000
probably

17559
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,000
just

17560
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:00,000
do

17565
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:01,000
because

17566
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,000
odds

17567
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:02,000
are

17568
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:03,000
you're

17569
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:03,000
not

17570
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:03,000
gonna

17571
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,000
have

17572
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:04,000
the

17573
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,000
funding

17574
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:05,000
to

17575
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:05,000
do

17576
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:05,000
this

17577
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:06,000
or

17578
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:06,000
something

17579
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:06,000
like

17580
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:06,000
that

17581
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,000
so

17582

18195
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:25,000

18197
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:26,000

we're

02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:52,000
greater

18830
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:55,000
we'll

18831
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:55,000
run

02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:56,000
that

18833
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,000

18834

18835
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,000
oh

18836
02:00:59,000 --> 02:00:59,000
is

18837
02:00:59,000 --> 02:00:59,000
not

18838
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,000
found

18839
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:00,000
that's

18840
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:00,000
because

18841
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:00,000
I

18842
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,000
spelled

18844
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:02,000
wrong

18845
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,000
so

18846
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:03,000
I

18847
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:03,000
guess

18848
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:03,000
it's

18849
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:03,000
good

18850
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:04,000
thing

18851
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:04,000
that

18852
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:04,000
I

18853
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,000
that

18854
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:05,000
it

18855
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:05,000
failed

18856
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,000
immediately

18857
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:06,000
so

18858
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:07,000
ec

18859
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
oh

18860
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:09,000
and

18861
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,000
we

18862
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:10,000
will

18863
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:10,000
try

18864
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,000
running

18865
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:11,000
it

18866
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:11,000
hopefully

18867
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:11,000
this

18868
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:12,000
doesn't

18869
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:12,000
blow

18870
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:12,000
up

18871
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:15,000
all

18872
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:15,000
right

18873
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:15,000
so

18874
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:15,000
we

18875
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:15,000
have

18876
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:16,000
no

18877
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:16,000
such

18878
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:17,000
file

18879
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:17,000
or

18880
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,000
directory

18881
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,000
so

18882
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:20,000
all

18883
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:20,000
right

18884
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:20,000
so

18885
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:20,000
I

18886
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:20,000
think

18887
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:21,000
I

18888
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:21,000
figured

18889
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:21,000
it

18890
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:21,000
out

18891
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,000
basically

18892
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:22,000
there

18893
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:22,000
is

18894
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:22,000
an

18895
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:22,000
issue

18896
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,000
with

18897
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:23,000
the

18898
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:23,000
command

18899
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,000
for

18900
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,000
I

18901
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:25,000
think

18902
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:25,000
it

18903
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:25,000
was

18904
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,000
this

18905
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:26,000
area

18906
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:27,000
here

18907
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:27,000
so

18908
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:28,000
don't

18909
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:28,000
worry

18910
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:28,000
just

18911
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,000
copy

18912
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:30,000
what

18913
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:30,000
I

18914
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:30,000
have

18915
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,000
in

18916
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:31,000
my

18917
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:32,000

18918
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:32,000
and

18919
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:32,000
just

18920
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:32,000
use

18921
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,000
that

18922
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:33,000
and

18923
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:33,000
it

18924
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:33,000
will

18925
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:34,000
just

18926
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:34,000
work

18927

now

that's

02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:42,000
going

this

19255
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:38,000

02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,000

it

19262
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:42,000

it

ahead

19620

and

19621
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:04,000
attempt

19622
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:04,000
to

19623
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,000
pull

19629
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:07,000
right

19630
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:08,000
here

19631
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:08,000
now

19632
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:08,000
we

19633
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,000
might

19634
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:09,000
run

19635
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:09,000

19638
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:10,000
it

19639
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:10,000
just

19640
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,000
kind

19641
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:11,000
of

19642
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:11,000
depends

19643
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,000
but

19644
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,000
hopefully

19645
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:13,000
with

19646
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,000
512

19647
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:14,000

ram

19650
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:14,000
it's

19651
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,000
going

19652
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:15,000
to

19653
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:15,000
be

19654
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:15,000
really

19655
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,000
tight

19656
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:16,000
I

19657
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:16,000
don't

19658
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:16,000
know

19659
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:16,000
if

19660
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:16,000
this

19661
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,000
is

19662
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:17,000
going

19663
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:17,000
to

19664
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:17,000
work

19665
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:20,000
we're

19666
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:20,000
probably

19667
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:21,000
this

19668
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:21,000
run

19669
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:21,000
and

19670
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:21,000
we'll

19671
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:21,000
attempt

19672
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:22,000
to

19673
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:22,000
run

19674
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:22,000
it

19675
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:22,000
and

19676
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:23,000
it

19677
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:23,000
looks

19678
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:23,000
like

19679
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:24,000
it

19680
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:24,000
might

19681
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:25,000
have

19682
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:26,000
worked

19683
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,000
so

19684
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:27,000
what

19685
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:27,000
we

19686
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:27,000
can

19687
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:27,000
do

19688
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:28,000
is

19689
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:28,000
if

19690
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:28,000
we

19691
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:28,000
go

to

19697
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:32,000
we

19698
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:32,000
grab

19699
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,000
our

we

19703
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:34,000
go

our

19706
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:34,000
knock

19707
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:35,000
him

19708
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:35,000
a

console

19710
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:36,000
and

19711
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:36,000
we

19712
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,000
just

19713
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:38,000
put

19714
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:38,000
in

19715
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,000
actually

19716
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:39,000
I'll

19717
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:39,000
just

19718
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:39,000
make

19719
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:39,000
a

19720
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:39,000

19721
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:40,000
thing

19722
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:41,000
colon

19723
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:41,000
and

19724
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:41,000
we'll

19725
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:42,000
put

19726
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:42,000
in

02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
7351

19728
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:45,000
so

19729
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:46,000
7351

19730
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:47,000
enter

19731
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:48,000
does

19732
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:48,000
it

19733
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:48,000
do

19734
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,000
anything

19735
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:49,000
that's

19736
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:49,000
the

19737
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,000
first

19738
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:50,000
question

19739
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,000
it

19740
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:52,000
doesn't

19741
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:52,000
look

19742
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:52,000
like

19743
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:52,000
it's

19744
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,000
going

19745
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:53,000
to

19746
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:53,000
so

19747
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:54,000
now

19748
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:54,000
we

19749
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:54,000
got

19750
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:54,000
to

19751
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:54,000
figure

19752
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:55,000
out

19753
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:55,000
is

19754
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:56,000
it

19755
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:56,000
this

19756
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,000
guy's

19757
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:57,000
fault

19758
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,000
it

19759
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:58,000
looks

19760
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:58,000
like

19761
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:59,000
this

19762
02:06:59,000 --> 02:06:59,000
is

19763
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:00,000
running

19764
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:00,000
so

19765
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:01,000
my

19766
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:02,000
question

19767
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:03,000
is

19768
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:04,000
server

19769
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:04,000
is

19770
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:04,000
ready

19771
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,000
to

19772
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:05,000
receive

19773
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:05,000
web

19774
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:06,000
requests

19775
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:06,000
so

19776
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:06,000
it

19777
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:06,000
did

19778
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,000
spin

19779
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:07,000
up

19780
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:07,000
properly

19781
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:08,000
it

19782
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:08,000
started

19783
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:08,000
the

19784
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:08,000

19786
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,000
properly

19787
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:11,000
so

19788
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:11,000
that's

19789
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:11,000
good

19790
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:12,000
news

19791
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,000
oh

19792
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:13,000

19793
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:13,000

19794
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:13,000
see

19795
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:13,000
it

19796
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:14,000
is

19797
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:14,000
just

19798
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:15,000
absolutely

19799
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:15,000
chugging

19800
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:15,000
though

19801
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:16,000
so

19802
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:16,000
if

19803
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:16,000
we

19804
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:16,000
take

19805
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:16,000
a

19806
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,000

19812
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:20,000
let's

19813
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:21,000
see

19814
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:21,000
it

19815
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:21,000
looks

19816
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,000
like

19817
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:22,000
our

19818
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:22,000

19820
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:23,000

19821
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:23,000
pretty

19822
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:24,000
high

19823
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:24,000

19824

19825
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:25,000
IO

19826
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:25,000
is

19827
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:26,000
relatively

19828
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:26,000
high

19829
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:26,000
as

19830
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:26,000
well

19831
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:27,000
we

19832
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:27,000
probably

19833
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:28,000
need

19834
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:28,000
to

19835
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:28,000
upgrade

19836
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,000
to

19837
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:29,000
have

19838
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:30,000
one

19839
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:30,000
gig

19840
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:30,000

19841
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:30,000
ram

19842
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,000
but

19843
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,000
at

19844
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:32,000
least

19845
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,000
it

19846
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:33,000
is

19847
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:34,000
running

19848
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:35,000
so

19849
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:36,000
there

19850
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:36,000
is

19851
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:36,000
that

19852
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,000
the

02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:37,000
question

19854
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:38,000
is

19855
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:39,000
so

19856
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:39,000
I

19857
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:39,000
was

19858
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:39,000
able

19859
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:39,000

it

19862
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:40,000
to

02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:40,000
stop

19864
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:40,000
so

19865
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:40,000
what

19866
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:41,000
we'll

19869
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:41,000
we'll

19871
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:42,000

19872
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:42,000

19922
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:00,000
so

19923
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:00,000
we'll

19924
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:00,000

20228
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:46,000
will

20229
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:47,000

20232
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:49,000
to

20233
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:50,000
and

20234
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:50,000
we'll

20235
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:50,000
go

20236
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:50,000
ahead

20237
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:50,000
and

20238
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:51,000
connect

20239
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:51,000

20240
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:51,000

20243
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:52,000
so

20244
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:52,000
now

20245
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:53,000
that

20246
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:53,000
should

20247
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:53,000
give

20250
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:54,000

20252
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:55,000
it

20253
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:56,000
needs

20254
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:56,000
to

20255
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:56,000

job

20258
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:57,000
so

20259
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:57,000
now

20260
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:57,000
we

20261
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:58,000
should

20262
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:58,000
be

20263
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:58,000
able

02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:58,000

20273
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:01,000
then

20274
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:02,000
hit

20277
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,000
and

20278
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:07,000
then

20279
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Docker

it

20286
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:10,000

20291
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:11,000
which

20292
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:11,000
it

20293
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:12,000
is

20294
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:12,000
you

20295
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:12,000
can

20296
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:12,000
see

20297
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:12,000
it's

20298
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:13,000
actually

20299
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:13,000

20301
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:13,000
just

20302
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:14,000
well

20303
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:15,000
the

20304
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:15,000

20305
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:15,000

20306
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:15,000

20307
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:16,000

20308
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:16,000

20309
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,000
cockroach

20310

up

20312
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:19,000
so

20313
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:19,000
now

20314
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:19,000
we're

20315
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:19,000
starting

20316
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:20,000
to

20317
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:20,000
get

20318
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:20,000
the

20319
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:20,000
proper

20320
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:21,000
logs

20321
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:21,000
that

20322
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:21,000
we

20323
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:21,000
expect

20324
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:22,000
so

20325
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:22,000
my

20326
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,000
guess

20327
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:23,000
is

20328
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:23,000
it

20329
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:23,000
had

20330
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:23,000
something

20331
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:23,000
to

20332
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:24,000
do

20333
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:24,000
with

20334
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:24,000
the

20335
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:24,000
lack

20336
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:25,000
of

20337
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:25,000
RAM

20338
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:25,000
that

20339
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:25,000
we

20340
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:26,000
had

20341
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:26,000
so

20342
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:26,000
let's

20343
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:27,000
try

20344
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:27,000
that

20345
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:27,000
we'll

20346
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:28,000
refresh

20347
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:29,000
and

20348
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:29,000
there

20349
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:29,000
we

20350
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:30,000
go

20351
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:30,000
so

20352
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:30,000
you

20353
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:30,000

we

02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:03,000
sometimes

20432
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:03,000
and

20433
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:03,000
that

20434
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:04,000

20435
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:04,000
some

issues

20437
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
but

20438
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:07,000
that's

20439
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:07,000
how

20440
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:08,000
easy

20441
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:08,000
it

20442
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:08,000
is

20443
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:08,000

02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:08,000

off

20449
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:10,000
now

20450
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:11,000

it

20608
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:07,000
would

02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:11,000
so

20624
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:11,000
that's

20625
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:12,000
basically

20626
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:12,000
how

works

20629
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:13,000
so

20630
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:14,000
now

20631
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:14,000
if

20838
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:31,000
our

20839
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Nakama

20840
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:32,000
instance

20841
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:32,000
so

20842
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,000
we

20843
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:33,000
do

20844
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:33,000

02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:33,000
the

20846
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:34,000
presences

20847
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:34,000
as

20848
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:35,000
expected

20849
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:36,000
but

20850
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:36,000
I

20851
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:36,000
feel

20852
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:36,000
like

20853
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:37,000
something

20854
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:38,000
here

20855
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:38,000
is

20856
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:39,000
wonky

20857
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:39,000
a

20858
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:40,000
little

20859
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:40,000

20860
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:40,000

20861
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:41,000
I

20862
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:41,000
think

20863
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:41,000
that's

20864
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:41,000
because

20865
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:42,000
I'm

20866
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:42,000

02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:45,000
I

20877
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:45,000

02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:43,000
of

21042
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:44,000
lag

21043
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:44,000
and

21044
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:44,000
I

21045
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:44,000
think

21046
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:45,000
the

21047
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:45,000
reason

21048
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:45,000
for

21049
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:45,000
that

21050
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:45,000
is

21051
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:46,000
because

21052
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:46,000
we're

21053
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,000
flooding

21054
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:47,000
the

21055
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:48,000
actual

21056
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Nakama

21057
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:49,000
instance

21058
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:50,000
because

21059
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:51,000
it

21060
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:52,000
has

21061
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,000
a

21062
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:53,000
bunch

21063
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:53,000
of

21064
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:53,000
data

21065
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:54,000
that

21066
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:54,000
it's

21067
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:54,000
passing

21068
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:54,000
through

21069
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,000
so

21070
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:55,000
we

21071
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:55,000
should

21072
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:55,000
probably

21073
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:56,000
figure

21074
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:56,000
out

21075
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:56,000
a

21076
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:56,000
better

21077
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:56,000
way

21078
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:56,000
to

21079
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,000
optimize

21080
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:57,000
this

21081
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:58,000
but

21082
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:58,000
at

21083
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:58,000
least

21084
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:58,000
we

21085
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:59,000
have

21086
02:14:59,000 --> 02:14:59,000
it

21087
02:14:59,000 --> 02:14:59,000
working

21088
02:14:59,000 --> 02:14:59,000
for

21089
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:00,000
now

21090
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,000
so

21091
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:01,000
at

21092
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:02,000
this

21093
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:02,000
point

21094
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:02,000
we've

21095
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:03,000
gone

21096
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:03,000
through

21097
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:03,000
quite

21098
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:04,000
a

21099
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:04,000
few

21100
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:04,000
things

21101
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:05,000
we

21102
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:05,000
talked

21103
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:05,000
about

21104
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:06,000
groups

21105
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:06,000
we

21106
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:06,000
talked

21107
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:07,000
about

chatting

21109

we

21111

about
