00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000
because

285
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000
we're

286
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
actually

287
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,000

I

294
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
really

295
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,000

300
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,000

301
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,000
that's

302
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,000
probably

303
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
going

304
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,000

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
be

433
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,000

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,000
little

435
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,000
bit

436
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
longer

437
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,000
but

438
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
that's

439
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,000
okay

440
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,000
we'll

441
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
make

442
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,000
it

443
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,000
work

444
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
for

445
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,000
what

446
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,000
we're

447
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,000

448
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
do

449
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,000
so

450
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
that's

451
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,000
fine

452
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and

453
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll

454
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
just

455
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,000
kind

456
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,000

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,000
organize

458
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
this

459
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,000
properly

460
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
then

461
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,000
we'll

462
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,000
add

463
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,000

464
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,000

466
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and

467
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,000
this

468
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
button

469
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000
is

470
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000
going

471
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000
to

472
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000
allow

474
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000
to

475
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
create

476
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,000

00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
group

478
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,000
now

479
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm

480
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,000
going

481
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,000
to

482
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,000
need

483
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,000
multiple

484
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
buttons

485
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,000
but

486
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,000
for

487
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,000
right

488
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
now

489
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,000
we'll

490
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,000
just

491
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,000
do

492
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
one

493
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I

494
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
think

495
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
so

496
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
we'll

497
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,000
go

498
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,000
ahead

499
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and

500
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,000
say

501
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
create

502
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,000

503
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
like

504
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,000
so

505
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and

506
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'll

507
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,000
probably

508
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
need

509
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,000
to

510
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,000
make

511
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,000
this

512
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,000
panel

513
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000

514
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,000

515
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,000
be

516
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,000
honest

I'm

518
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,000

519
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,000

523
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
so

524
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,000
we'll

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,000
an

open

862
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,000
means

863
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,000
if

864
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,000
it's

865
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000

868
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000

869
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
if

870
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
people

871
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
can

872
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
actually

873
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,000
see

874
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,000
it

875
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,000

876
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
index

877
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,000
it

878
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000

879
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,000
other

881
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
so

882
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000
if

883
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000
you

884
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000

false

886
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
then

887
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000
it's

888
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000

891
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000

892
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
if

893
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,000
you

don't

895
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,000
want

896
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
it

897
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,000
to

898
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,000
be

899
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
listable

900
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
which

901
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
we'll

902
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
discuss

903
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
listing

904
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
in

905
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
a

906
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,000
little

907
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,000
bit

908
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
but

909
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,000
it

910
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,000
allows

911
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,000
you

912
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
to

913
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
basically

914
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
say

915
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
is

916
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,000
this

917
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,000
a

918
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,000

919
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
group

920
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
so

921
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm

922
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
going

923
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
to

924
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
say

925
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
true

926
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
because

927
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,000
it

928
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
makes

929
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,000
sense

930
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,000
to

931
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,000
have

932
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,000

935
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and

936
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
then

937
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
you

938
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
can

939
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
have

940
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,000
a

945
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,000
now

946
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
once

947
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,000
this

948
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
is

949
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,000

950
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,000

it

954
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
so

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
make

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000

1236
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I

1237
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,000

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
so

1248
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,000
we'll

1249
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,000

1261
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
we'll

1262
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,000

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
but

1700
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,000
that's

1701
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,000
okay

1702
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
there's

1703
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
probably

1704
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
a

1705
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
master

1706
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,000
account

1707
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,000
that

1708
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
it's

1709
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,000
using

1710
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
actually

1711
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,000
it's

1712
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,000
right

1713
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
here

1714
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,000
jj

1715
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
rb

1716
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
right

1717
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,000
here

1718
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
so

1719
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,000
i'm

1720
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,000
not

1721
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,000
sure

1722
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
why

1723
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,000
it

1724
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,000
used

1725
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,000
this

1726
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
specific

1727
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,000
one

1728
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
unless

1729
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,000
i

1730
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
logged

1731
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,000
in

1732
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
and

1733
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
created

1734
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,000
it

1735
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,000
with

1736
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,000
device

1737
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
authentication

1738
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
which

1739
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,000
is

1740
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,000
possible

1741
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
but

1742
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,000
that's

1743
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
okay

1744
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,000
we'll

1745
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,000
figure

1746
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
that

1747
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,000
out

1748
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,000
in

1749
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,000
a

1750
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,000
minute

1751
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
but

1752
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,000
that's

1753
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
basically

1754
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,000
how

1755
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,000
we

1756
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
create

1757
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,000
a

1758
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,000
group

1759
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
now

1760
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
you

1761
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
can

1762
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
see

1763
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
we

1764
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
also

1765
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
printed

1766
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,000
out

1767
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
a

1768
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,000
group

1769
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,000
as

1770
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,000
well

1771
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
so

1772
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
you

1773
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
can

1774
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
see

1775
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
here

1776
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
we

1777
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,000
have

1778
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,000
our

1779
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000

1780
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,000

which

1782
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,000
is

1783
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,000
right

1784
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
here

1785
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,000
the

1786
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,000

db

1790
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
so

1791
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,000
this

1792
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,000
is

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,000

id

1796
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
so

1797
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,000
our

1798
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000

jj

1801
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
so

1802
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,000
we

1803
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,000
must

1804
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
have

1805
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
logged

1806
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,000
in

1807
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,000
with

1808
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,000
device

1809
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
authentication

1810
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
which

1811
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,000
means

1812
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,000
i

1813
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
probably

1814
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,000
didn't

1815
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
reset

1816
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,000
my

1818
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
authentication

1819
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
stuff

1820
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
so

1821
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,000
let

1822
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,000
me

1823
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,000
take

1824
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,000
a

1825
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
look

1826
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,000
at

1827
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,000
that

1828
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,000
real

1829
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,000
quick

1830
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,000
my

1831
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
apologies

1832
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
i

1833
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
may

1834
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,000
not

1835
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,000
have

1836
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,000
reset

1837
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
some

1838
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,000
of

1839
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,000
my

1840
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,000
code

1841
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
so

1842
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,000
that

1843
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,000
it

1844
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,000
worked

1845
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
properly

1846
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
did

1847
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
user

1848
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,000
authentication

1849
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
instead

1850
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
of

1851
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
our

1852
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,000
um

1853
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
device

1854
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,000
authentication

1855
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
so

1856
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,000
my

1857
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,000
guess

1858
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,000
is

1859
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
that's

1860
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000
probably

1861
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000
what

1862
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000
it

1863
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000
is

1864
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
so

1865
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,000
if

1866
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,000
i

1867
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,000

right

1873
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,000
here

1874
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
i'm

1882
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and

1883
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,000
i'm

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,000
i'll

00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,000
you

you

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,000
know

2661
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
go

2662
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,000
from

00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
this

2666
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,000
should

2667
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,000
probably

2668
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
be

2673
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
it'll

2674
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,000
be

i

2677
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,000
guess

2678
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,000
for

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
now

2680
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,000
but

2681
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,000
it's

2682
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,000
just

2683
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,000

00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
i'm

00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,000
that's

2692
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,000
okay

2693
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000

00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,000

make

3195
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,000
it

3196
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000

3211
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
we'll

3212
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,000

3276
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,000
basically

3277
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
when

i

3898
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
guess

3899
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,000
it'd

3900
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,000
be

so

3907
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
and

3908
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,000
i'll

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,000
think

4623
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,000
there's

4624
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,000
an

4625
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
issue

4626
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,000
here

4627
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
with

4628
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,000
how

4629
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,000
they

4630
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,000
have

4631
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
their

4632
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,000
stuff

4633
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,000
set

4634
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,000
up

4635
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
so

4636
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,000
what

4637
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,000
if

4638
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
we

4639
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,000
come

4640
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,000
back

4641
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
here

4642
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
and

4643
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,000
we

4644
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,000
do

4645
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
null

4646
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
instead

4647
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,000
so

4648
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,000
if

4649
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,000
we

4650
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
come

4651
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,000
in

4652
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,000

4653
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,000
null

4654
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
just

4655
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,000
to

4656
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,000
see

4657
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,000
if

4658
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,000
that

4659
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
fixes

4660
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,000
the

4661
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
problem

4662
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
so

4663
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,000
we'll

4664
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,000
come

4665
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,000
in

4666
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,000
here

4667
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,000
we'll

4668

type

4669
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,000
strong

4670
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
and

4671
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,000
it's

4672
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
still

4673
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,000
mad

4674
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
oh

4675
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,000
that's

4676
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,000
because

4677
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,000
i

4678
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,000

so

4682
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
that's

4683
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,000
fair

4684
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
that's

4685
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,000
understandable

4686
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
so

4687
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,000

want

4831
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,000
it

4832
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,000
to

4833
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
do

4834
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,000
because

4835
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,000
of

4836
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,000
course

4837
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
it's

4838
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,000
not

4839
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
welcome

4840
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,000
to

4841
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
programming

4842
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,000
let's

4843
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,000
see

4844
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,000
what

4845
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
happens

4846
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
if

4847
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
i

4848
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
do

4849
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
capital

4850
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,000
s

4851
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,000
it's

4852
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
probably

4853
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,000
capital

4854
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,000
case

4855
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
sensitive

4856
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,000
so

4857
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
we'll

4858
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,000
come

4859
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,000
in

4860
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
here

4861
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,000
and

4862
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,000
we'll

4863
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
take

4864
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,000
a

4865
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,000
look

4866
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,000
at

4867
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
our

4868
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,000
results

4869
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
still

4870
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
got

4871
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,000
nothing

4872
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
back

4873
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,000
so

4874
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
we'll

4875
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,000
continue

4876
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
through

4877
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,000
what

4878
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
happens

4879
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,000
if

4880
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,000
i

4881
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
do

4882
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,000
a

4883
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
percent

4884
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
sign

4885
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,000
and

4886
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,000
see

4887
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,000
if

4888
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
that

4889
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,000
gives

4890
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,000
us

4891
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
something

4892
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,000
back

4893
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,000
now

4894
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
because

4895
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,000
it

4896
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
might

4897
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,000
be

4898
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,000
that

4899
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
it

4900
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,000
needs

4901
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,000
to

4902
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,000
be

4903
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,000
a

4904
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
query

4905
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,000
of

4906
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,000
some

4907
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
description

4908
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,000
so

4909
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,000
we

4910
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,000
can

4911
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
check

4912
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,000
that

4913
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
out

4914
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,000
real

4915
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,000
quick

4916
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
yep

4917
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,000
it

4918
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,000
needs

4919
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,000
to

4920
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,000
be

4921
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,000
a

4922
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
query

4923
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,000
so

4924
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,000
you

4925
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,000
can

4926
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,000
see

4927
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
it

4928
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,000
pulled

4929
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,000
back

4930
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,000
the

4931
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,000
one

4932
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
that

4933
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,000
we're

4934
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,000
looking

4935
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,000
for

4936
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,000
so

4937
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
it

4938
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,000
pulled

4939
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,000
back

4940
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,000
our

4941
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,000
group

4942
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
so

4943
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,000
when

4944
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,000
you

4945
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
do

4946
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,000
a

4947
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,000
text

4948
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
just

4949
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,000
be

4950
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,000
aware

4951
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
of

4952
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,000
that

4953
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,000
you're

4954
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,000
going

4955
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,000
to

4956
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,000
need

4957
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,000
to

4958
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
make

4959
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,000
it

4960
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,000
into

4961
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,000
an

4962
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,000
actual

4963
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
query

4964
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
instead

4965
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
so

4966
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,000
you

4967
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,000
need

4968
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,000
to

4969
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,000
add

4970
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,000
that

4971
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
percent

4972
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,000
sign

4973
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,000
at

4974
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
the

4975
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,000
end

4976
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,000
so

4977
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
that's

4978
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,000
just

4979
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,000
something

4980
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,000
to

4981
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,000
keep

4982
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
in

4983
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,000
mind

4984
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
now

4985
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
you'll

4986
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,000
see

4987
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,000
when

4988
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
i

4989
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,000
hit

4990
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,000
play

4991
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
it's

4992
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,000
going

4993
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,000
to

4994
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
print

4995
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,000
out

4996
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
strong

4997
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,000
gamers

4998
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
right

4999
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,000
there

5000
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
so

5001
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,000
that's

5002
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
basically

5003
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,000
how

5004
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
you

5005
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,000
can

list

5008
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,000
filter

5009
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,000

groups

5011
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
so

5012
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,000
that

5013
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,000
allows

5014
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
us

5015

00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
those

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,000
groups

5019
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,000

5020
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
hunt

5021

if

you

5027
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,000
look

you

5029
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,000
can

00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,000
let's

5252
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,000
take

00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,000
this

5257
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000

5262
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,000
let's

5263
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000

00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,000
it's

5269
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,000

you

00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,000
we

now

5421
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000

00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
so

5426
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,000
that's

5427
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
something

5428
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,000
that

actually

do

00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,000
pull

00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,000
that

5440
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,000

00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
really

5443
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,000
useful

something

and

6085
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,000
you

6086
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
will

6087
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,000
see

6088
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,000
that

6089
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,000
if

6090
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,000
i

6091
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
come

6092
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,000
in

6093
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,000
here

6094
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,000
and

6095
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,000
i

6096
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
refresh

6097
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,000
this

6098
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
you'll

6099
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,000
see

6100
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,000
that

6101
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,000
that

6102
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
worked

6103
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,000
and

6104
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,000
that's

6105
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
because

6106
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,000
we

6107
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,000
bound

6108
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
that

6109
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,000
parameter

6110
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
right

6111
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,000
here

6112
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
well

6113
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,000
if

6114
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,000
i

6115
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,000
could

6116
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,000
find

6117
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,000
it

6118
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
right

6119
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
here

6120
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,000
to

6121
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
actually

6122
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
work

6123
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,000
so

6124
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
that's

6125
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,000
a

6126
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,000
way

6127
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,000
that

6128
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,000
we

6129
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,000
can

6130
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
go

6131
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,000
about

6132
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
making

6133
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,000
a

6134
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,000
group

6135
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
selection

6136
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,000
system

6137
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
relatively

6138
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,000
simple

6139
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
and

6140
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,000
that's

6141
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,000
how

6142
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
we

6143
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,000
can

6144
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,000
actually

6145
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,000
list

6146
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
our

6147
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,000
groups

6148
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
as

6149
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,000
well

6150
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
so

6151
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,000
i

6152
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,000
know

6153
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,000
that

6154
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,000
that's

6155
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,000
kind

6156
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,000
of

6157
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
a

6158
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
complicated

6159
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
way

6160
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,000
to

6161
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,000
show

6162
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,000
it

6163
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
but

6164
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,000
i

6165
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,000
figured

6166
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,000
that

6167
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
it

6168
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,000
was

6169
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,000
an

6170
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,000
interesting

6171
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
way

6172
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
to

6173
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,000
approach

6174
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,000
it

6175
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
and

6176
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,000
i

6177
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,000
figured

6178
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,000
you

6179
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,000
guys

6180
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,000

6181
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
appreciate

6182
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,000
that

6183
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
so

6184
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,000
now

6185
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,000
the

6186
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,000
question

6187
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,000
is

6188
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
what

6189
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,000
if

6190
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000

6197
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,000
maybe

6198
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
demote

6318
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,000
like

6319
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000

00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,000
about

00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,000
that

6328
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
big

6329
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,000
we'll

00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
here

6333
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,000
we'll

6334
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,000
say

6335
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
user

6336
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
user

6337
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
to

00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
manage

6339
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,000
we'll

6340
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,000
say

6341
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
and

6342
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,000
then

6343
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
we'll

6344
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,000

and

6348
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
hopefully

6349
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,000
we

6350
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,000
won't

6351
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,000
run

6352
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
out

6353
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,000
of

6354
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,000
space

6355
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,000
if

6356
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,000
we

6357
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
do

6358
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,000
we'll

6359
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,000
figure

6360
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
something

6361
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,000
out

6362
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,000
but

6363
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
let's

6364
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,000
right

6365
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,000
click

6366
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,000
add

6367
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
in

6368
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,000

6370
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,000
node

6371
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,000
let's

6372
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
add

6373
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,000
in

6374
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,000
a

00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,000
button

6376
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
we'll

6377
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
add

6378
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,000
in

6379
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,000
a

6380
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,000
button

6381
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,000
for

6382
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
promoting

6383
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
right

6384
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,000
here

6385
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
like

6386
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,000
so

6387
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
and

6388
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
if

6389
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,000
i

6390
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
think

6391
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,000
about

6392
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
it

6393
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,000
for

6394
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,000
a

6395
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,000
second

6396
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
with

6397
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,000
groups

6398
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
we

6399
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,000
need

6400
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,000
to

6401
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
promote

6402
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,000
demote

6403
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
kick

6404
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,000
and

6405
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
ban

6406
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
somebody

6407
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,000
and

6408
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,000
then

6409
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,000
also

6410
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
leave

6411
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,000
that

6412
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,000
group

6413
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
so

6414
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,000
we'll

6415
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,000
need

6416
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
to

6417
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,000
figure

6418
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,000
out

6419
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,000
a

6420
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,000
way

6421
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
to

6422
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,000
give

6423
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,000
ourselves

6424
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,000
a

6425
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
little

6426
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,000
bit

6427
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,000
more

6428
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,000
space

6429
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
here

6430
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,000
because

6431
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,000
i'm

6432
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,000

out

6434
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,000
so

6435
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
maybe

6436
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,000
i

6437
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,000
can

6438
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,000

butt

6443
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,000

6444
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,000
up

6445
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,000

00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,000
little

6447
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
bit

6448
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,000
closer

6449
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000

more

6459
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:37,000
space

6460
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
but

6461
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,000
we

6462
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,000
can

i

6470
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,000
believe

6471
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
we

6472
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,000
would

6473
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,000
need

we

6485
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,000

we

6498
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,000

they

sure

6824
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,000
why

6825
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,000
they

00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,000
so

6833
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,000
it's

6834
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,000

00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,000
we

we'll

right

6884
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,000

7775
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
because

7776
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:06,000
we

7777
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:06,000

7784
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,000
that's

7785
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
how

7786
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:09,000

7790
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
it's

00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:10,000
actually

7792
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:10,000
really

7793
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:10,000
easy

7794
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
you

7795
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:11,000
just

7796
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:11,000

7800
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000

7801
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,000
now

7802
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,000
what

00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,000
happens

7804
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000

00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,000
you

7806
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,000

group

7811
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
well

7812
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:16,000
we're

7813
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:16,000
going

7814
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:16,000
to

7819
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:17,000

that

7821
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
so

7822
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,000
let's

7823
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
duplicate

7824
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,000

00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
i

7834
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,000
guess

7835
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,000
we're

7836
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000

part

9841
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:37,000
but

9842
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:37,000
there

9843
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:37,000
is

9844
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:37,000
a

9845
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
way

9846
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,000
to

9847
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,000
make

9848
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,000
it

9849
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,000
so

9850
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,000
it

9851
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
automatically

9852
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:39,000
scrolls

9853
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:39,000
to

9854
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:39,000
the

9855
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
bottom

9856
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:40,000
but

9857
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
that's

9858
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:41,000
okay

9859
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
right

9860
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:42,000
now

9861
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
so

9862
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:43,000
this

9863
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
is

9864
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:44,000
basically

9865
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:44,000
what

9866
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000

9869
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:45,000

9870
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:45,000
going

9871
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:45,000

9872
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000

9873
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:46,000
it's

9874
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:46,000
going

9875
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:46,000

relatively

9878
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
simple

9879
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:47,000
but

9880
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
it's

9881
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:48,000

01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:27,000
it

9987
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:27,000
it's

9988
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
not

9989
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:28,000
the

9990
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:28,000
most

9991
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:28,000
ideal

9992
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
situation

9993
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:29,000
because

9994
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:29,000
once

9995
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:29,000
you're

9996
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
connected

9997
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,000

10000
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:31,000
you

10001
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:31,000
should

10002
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:31,000
probably

10003
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
just

10004
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:32,000
be

10005
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
connected

10006
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:33,000
to

10007
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:33,000
that

10008
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
channel

10009
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:34,000
right

10010
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
instead

10011
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:35,000
of

10012
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:35,000
passing

10013
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:35,000
in

10014
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
this

10015
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:36,000
value

10016
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:36,000
here

10017
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
but

10018
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
we

10019
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:38,000
can

10020
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:38,000
basically

10021
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
throw

10022
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:39,000
a

10023
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
value

10024
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
up

10025
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:41,000
at

10026
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
the

01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:42,000
top

10028
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:42,000
and

10029
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:42,000
basically

10030
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
just

10031
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:43,000
save

10032
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:43,000
it

10033
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:43,000
across

10034
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
different

10035
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:44,000
functions

10036
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
and

10037
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:45,000
that

10038
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:45,000
would

10039
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:45,000
solve

10040
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:45,000
this

10041
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
problem

10042
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:46,000
but

10043
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:46,000
for

10044
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:46,000
right

10045
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
now

10046
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:47,000
we'll

10047
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:47,000

11067
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:37,000
a

11068
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
json

11069
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:38,000
value

11070
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
so

11071
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:39,000
that's

11072
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:39,000
something

11073
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
that

11074
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:40,000
i

11075
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:40,000
didn't

11076
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:40,000
think

11077
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:40,000
about

11078
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
i'm

11079
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:41,000
talking

11080
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:41,000
without

11081
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
thinking

11082
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
as

11083
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:43,000
i'm

11084
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:43,000
doing

11085
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:43,000
this

11086
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:43,000
tutorial

11087
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
so

11088
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:44,000
forgive

11089
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
me

11090
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:45,000
but

11091
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
we

11092
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:46,000
need

11093
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:46,000
to

11094
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:46,000
actually

11095
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:46,000
parse

11096
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
that

11097
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:47,000
data

11098
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:47,000
so

11099
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:47,000
now

11100
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:47,000
if

11101
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
we

11102
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:48,000
hit

11103
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
send

11104
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:49,000
you'll

11105
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:49,000
see

11106
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
test

11107
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:50,000
test

11108
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
test

11109
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,000
this

11110
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:53,000
is

11111
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
a

11112
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:54,000
test

11113
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
message

11114
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:55,000
like

11115
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
so

11116
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
test

11117
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:57,000
to

11118
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:57,000
this

11119
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:57,000
is

11120
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
a

11121
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:58,000
test

11122
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:58,000
message

11123
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
and

11124
01:09:59,000 --> 01:09:59,000
that's

11125
01:09:59,000 --> 01:09:59,000
basically

11126
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
how

11127
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
you

11128
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
could

11129
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
do

11130
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
a

11131
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
very

11132
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:01,000
basic

11133
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
communication

11134
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:02,000
system

11135
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
so

11136
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:03,000
now

11137
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
the

11138
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:04,000
question

11139
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:04,000
is

11140
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:04,000

11141
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
great

11142
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:05,000
that's

11143
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
fine

11144
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
but

11145
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:07,000
how

11146
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000

11715
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:25,000

11719
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:28,000
well

11720
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
where

11721
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:29,000

01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:31,000
and

11726
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
why

11727
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:32,000
it's

11728
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
important

11729
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:33,000
is

11730
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:33,000
because

11731
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:33,000
you

11732
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:33,000

01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:33,000
do

11734
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
what's

11735
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:34,000

so

11741
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:37,000
because

11742
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:37,000
it's

11743
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:37,000

11758
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
so

11759
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:42,000
the

11760
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
reason

11761
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:43,000
why

we

01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:30,000

01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
this

12084
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
is

12085
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:51,000
chat

12086
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:51,000
stuff

12087
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
so

12088
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,000
we'll

12089
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,000
go

12090
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,000
ahead

12091
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,000
and

12092
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,000
just

12093
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
drop

12094
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:53,000
it

12095
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:53,000
right

12096
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:53,000
there

12097
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
and

12098
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:54,000
that'll

12099
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:54,000
just

12100
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:54,000
kind

12101
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
of

12102
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:55,000
keep

12103
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
it

12104
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:56,000
within

12105
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:56,000
the

12106
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000

12107
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:57,000
area

12108
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:57,000
so

12109
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
that

12110
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:58,000
way

12111
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:58,000
i

12112
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:58,000
can

12113
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
basically

12114
01:15:59,000 --> 01:15:59,000
come

12115
01:15:59,000 --> 01:15:59,000
in

12116
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
here

12117
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:00,000
and

12118
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:00,000
do

12119
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
this

12120
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:01,000
and

12121
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:01,000
say

12122
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
chat

12123
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
room

12124
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
code

12125
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:05,000
right

12126
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:05,000
here

12127
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:05,000
and

12128
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
that'll

12129
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:06,000
give

12130
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:06,000
me

12131
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:06,000
somewhere

12132
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:06,000
to

12133
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
actually

12134
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:07,000
look

12135
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:07,000
at

12136
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
this

12137
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:08,000
now

12138
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:08,000
what

12139
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:08,000
we

12140
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
can

12141
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:09,000
do

12142
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:09,000
is

12143
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:09,000
we

12144
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:09,000
can

12145
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
basically

12146
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:10,000
just

12147
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:10,000
grab

12148
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
this

12149
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
copy

12150
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:12,000
it

12151
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
and

12152
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:13,000
paste

12153
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
and

12154
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:15,000
that's

12155
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:15,000
all

12156
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:15,000
we

12157
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:15,000
need

12158
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:15,000
to

12159
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
do

12160
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:16,000
and

12161
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:16,000
then

12162
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
in

12163
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:17,000
theory

12164
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:17,000
this

12165
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
should

12166
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:18,000
just

12167
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:18,000
work

12168
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
so

12169
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:19,000
now

12170
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:19,000
if

12171
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:19,000
we

12172
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
hit

12173
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:20,000
play

12174
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
in

12175
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
theory

12176
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:22,000
if

12177
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:22,000
we're

12178
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
lucky

12179
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:23,000
it

12180
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:23,000
will

12181
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:23,000
work

12182
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
so

12183
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:24,000
we'll

12184
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:24,000
go

12185
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:24,000
here

12186
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
we'll

12187
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:25,000

12196
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:30,000
we

12197
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:30,000
got

12206
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000

we

12208
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000

it

12277
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:13,000

we

13103
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:34,000
can

13104
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
actually

13105
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:35,000
communicate

13106
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:35,000
with

13107
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
so

13108
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:36,000
now

this

01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
should

13113
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:38,000
work

13114
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:38,000

see

13128
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
so

13129
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:42,000
we'll

13130
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,000

01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:46,000
then

13140
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:46,000
we'll

01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000

13148
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
it's

13149
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:51,000
mad

13150
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
and

13151
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:52,000
that's

13152
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:52,000
because

13153
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000

13154
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000

13156
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:55,000
let's

13157
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,000
see

13158
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
with

13161
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
it

13162
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:58,000
looks

13163
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:58,000
like

13164
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:58,000
it's

01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:00,000
that's

13170
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:00,000

01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:01,000
we'll

13174
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:01,000

01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:53,000

01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:54,000

13292
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:54,000
i

13293
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
commented

just

01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:56,000
so

13298
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:56,000
we

13299
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:56,000
could

13300
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:56,000
check

13301
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:56,000

13304
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:57,000
what

13305
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:57,000
i

13306
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:57,000
think

13307
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
is

13308
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:58,000
going

13309
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
on

13310
01:23:59,000 --> 01:23:59,000
here

13311
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
is

13312
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
remember

13313
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
in

13314
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:02,000
our

13315
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
previous

13316
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
tutorial

13317
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:04,000
we

13318
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
had

13319
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
test

13320
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:07,000
block

13321
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
test

13322
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:09,000
two

13323
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
and

13324
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:10,000
because

13325
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
they're

13326
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:11,000
blocked

13327
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,000
they

13328
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:12,000
can't

13329
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:12,000
send

13330
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:12,000
them

13331
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,000
messages

13332
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
so

13333
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:15,000
it

13334
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:15,000
completely

13335
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:15,000
stops

13336
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
them

13337
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:16,000
from

13338
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:16,000
being

13339
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:16,000
able

13340
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:16,000
to

13341
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
communicate

13342
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:17,000
with

13343
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:17,000
each

13344
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:17,000
other

13345
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
and

13346
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:18,000
that's

13347
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
why

13348
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
this

13349
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:20,000
is

13350
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:20,000
happening

13351
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
so

13352
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:21,000
if

13353
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:21,000
i

13354
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:21,000
remove

13355
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
this

13356
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
let's

13357
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:23,000
see

13358
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:23,000
what

13359
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
happens

13360
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:24,000
if

13361
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:24,000
i

13362
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:24,000
do

13363
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
that

13364
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:25,000
so

13365
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:25,000
we'll

13366
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:25,000
go

13367
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
ahead

13368
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:26,000
and

13369
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:26,000
come

13370
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:26,000
in

13371
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:26,000
here

13372
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
we'll

13373
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:27,000
control

13374
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
s

13375
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:28,000
we'll

13376
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:28,000
hit

13377
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
play

13378
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
and

13379
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:30,000
then

13380
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:30,000
we'll

13381
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
try

13382
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:31,000

13386
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:32,000
so

13387
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:32,000
we'll

we

01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:41,000
will

that

13410
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:43,000
will

13411

work

13413
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,000
now

13414
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:45,000
the

13415
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
reason

13416
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:46,000
why

13417
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
this

13418
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:47,000
didn't

13419
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
work

13420
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:48,000
was

13421
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:48,000
because

13422
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
test

13423
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:49,000
had

13424
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
test

13425
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:50,000
two

13426
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:50,000
blocks

13427
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
so

13428
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:51,000
since

13429
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:51,000
they're

13430
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:51,000
blocked

13431
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
they

13432
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:52,000
can't

13433
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:52,000
communicate

13434
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000

01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:53,000
all

13436
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
so

13437
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:54,000
that's

13438
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:54,000
the

13439
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:54,000
reason

13440
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,000
why

13441
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:55,000
this

13442
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
happened

13443
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
so

13444
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
it

13445
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:58,000
was

13446
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:58,000
my

13447
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000

13448
01:24:59,000 --> 01:24:59,000

13449
01:24:59,000 --> 01:24:59,000
that

13450
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
was

13451
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:00,000
basically

13452
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:00,000
the

13453
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
reasoning

13454
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:01,000
now

13455
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:01,000
if

13456
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:01,000
we

13459
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
and

13460
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:03,000
stop

13461
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
this

13462
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
and

13463
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:05,000
then

13464
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:05,000
we

13465
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:05,000

then

01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:10,000
we

we

here

14127
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:33,000
so

14128
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
if

14129
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:34,000

i

14135
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:35,000
could

14136
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:35,000
actually

14137
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
pull

14138
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:36,000
back

14139
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:36,000
the

14141
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,000
information

14142
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,000
and

14143
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:38,000
switch

14144
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:38,000
between

14145
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:38,000
them

14146
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
really

14147
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:39,000
easily

14148
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
using

14149
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
this

14150
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:41,000
object

14151
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:42,000
and

14152
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,000
i'll

14153
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:43,000
probably

14154
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,000
go

14155
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:44,000
through

14156
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:44,000
that

14157
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
later

14158
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
but

14159
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:46,000
it's

14160
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:46,000
a

14161
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:46,000
way

14162
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
to

14163
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:47,000
extend

14164
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
our

14165
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000

14166
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:49,000
to

14167
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:49,000
be

14168
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:49,000
a

14169
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:49,000
bit

14170
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
more

14171
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
useful

14172
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
if

14173
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:52,000
that

14174
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:52,000
makes

14175
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:52,000
sense

14176
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000
so

14177
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
if

14178
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:55,000
you

14179
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:55,000

01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:54,000
for

14323
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,000
instance

14324
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:55,000
if

14325
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:55,000
we

14326
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:55,000
come

14327
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:55,000
in

14328
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:55,000
here

14329
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,000
and

14330
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:57,000
we

14331
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
go

14332
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:58,000
and

14333
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
subscribe

01:30:59,000 --> 01:30:59,000

01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,000
those

14336
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:00,000
friend

14337
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:00,000
channels

14338
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,000
so

14339
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:01,000
if

14340
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:01,000
we

14341
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:01,000
grab

14342
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
this

14343
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:02,000
guy

14344
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
bring

14345
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:03,000
it

14346
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:03,000
down

14347
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
here

14348
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:04,000
come

14349
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:04,000
in

14350
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
here

14351
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:05,000
and

14352
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:05,000
then

14353
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
basically

14354
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:06,000
just

14355
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000

i

14360
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:11,000
guess

14361
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:11,000
it's

14362
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:11,000
going

14363
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
to

14364
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:12,000

and

14373
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:20,000
then

14374
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:20,000
we

14375
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:20,000

14376
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:20,000

14414
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
confusing

14415
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:34,000
this

14417
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
probably

14418
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:35,000
going

we

14425
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:39,000

this

01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
we'll

14731
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:50,000
pass

14732
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:50,000

01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:50,000
channel

14735
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
that'll

14736
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:51,000
pass

14737
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:51,000
back

14738
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
all

14739
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:52,000
of

14740
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:52,000

14742
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000

14743
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:53,000
that

14744
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:53,000
channel

14745
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
this

14746
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:55,000
is

14747
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:55,000
a

01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:55,000
coroutine

14749
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:55,000
so

14750
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
it

14751
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:56,000
must

14752
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:56,000
be

14753
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:56,000

01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,000
makes

14758
01:33:59,000 --> 01:33:59,000
sense

14759
01:33:59,000 --> 01:33:59,000
so

14760
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
await

14761
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:02,000

this

14767
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:04,000
we'll

we're

see

01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:43,000
how

01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:43,000
we're

asynchronously

14868
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:45,000
so

14869
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:45,000
we

14870
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
really

14871
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:46,000
could

01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:46,000
just

01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
grab

section

14876
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:50,000
here

14877
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:52,000
and

14878
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,000
just

14879
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:53,000
paste

14880
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:53,000
it

14881
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
right

14882
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:54,000
here

14883
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
on

14884
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:56,000
this

01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
guy

14886
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:57,000
like

14887
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:57,000
so

14888
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
and

14889
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:58,000
that'll

14890
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
basically

14891
01:34:59,000 --> 01:34:59,000
solve

14892
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:00,000
that

14893
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:00,000
problem

14894
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
right

14895
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:01,000
there

14896
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:01,000
now

14897
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
technically

14898
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:02,000
this

14899
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:02,000
is

14900
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
duplicated

14901
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:03,000
code

14902
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:03,000
and

14903
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:03,000
that's

14904
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
probably

14905
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:04,000
not

14906
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:04,000
the

14907
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:04,000
most

14908
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,000

situation

14910
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,000
but

14911
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:06,000
that's

14912
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
probably

14913
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:07,000
okay

14914
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000

14915
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:08,000
right

14916
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:08,000

14968
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:32,000
maybe

01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:32,000
we

01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:32,000

01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
just

01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:33,000

01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:37,000

01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:37,000
able

15750
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,000
to

15754
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
and

15755
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:40,000
it

15756
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:40,000
should

15757
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:40,000
just

15758
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
take

15759
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:41,000
it

15760
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:41,000
in

15761
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:41,000
theory

15762
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,000
invalid

15763
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:42,000
get

15764

15766
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,000
null

15767
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:44,000
that's

15768
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
fine

15769
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:45,000
my

15770
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:45,000
guess

15771
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:45,000
is

15772
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,000
that's

15773
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:46,000
because

15774
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,000

15778
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000

15780
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:49,000

01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
now

15782
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:50,000
we're

01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
but

15919
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:48,000
that's

15920
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:48,000
not

15921
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:48,000

i'm

15932
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000

it's

01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:54,000

01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,000
so

16971
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:37,000
you

16972
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:37,000
can

16973
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:37,000
actually

16974
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,000
choose

16975
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:38,000

and

16979
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:40,000
pass

16986
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:43,000
things

16987
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:43,000
like

16988
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,000
that

16989
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:44,000
by

01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,000
that

16996
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:47,000

16998
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:47,000
that's

16999
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,000
way

17000
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:48,000
beyond

17001
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,000

but

17007
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:50,000
that's

17008
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,000

and

17041
01:48:59,000 --> 01:48:59,000
actually

17042
01:48:59,000 --> 01:48:59,000
have

17043
01:48:59,000 --> 01:48:59,000
them

17044
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,000
handle

17045
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:00,000
a

17046
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:00,000
lot

17047
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:00,000
of

you

17051
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:01,000
but

17052
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:01,000
this

17053
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:01,000
is

17054
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:01,000
a

17055
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:01,000
good

17056
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:02,000
way

17057
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:02,000
to

17058
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:02,000
kind

17059
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:02,000
of

17060
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,000
get

17061
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,000
started

17062
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:04,000
into

17063
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:04,000
that

17064
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,000
if

17065
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:05,000
that

17066
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:05,000
makes

17067
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:05,000
sense

17068
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,000
so

17069
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:07,000
let's

17070
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:07,000
go

17071
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:07,000
ahead

17072
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,000
and

17073
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:08,000
talk

17074
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,000
about

17075
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:09,000
how

17076
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:09,000
to

17077
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:09,000
create

17078
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:09,000
a

17079
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,000
droplet

17080
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:10,000
so

17081
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:10,000
let's

17082
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:10,000
go

17083
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:10,000
up

17084
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:10,000
here

17085
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:10,000
to

17086
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:10,000
the

17087
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,000
upper

17088
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:11,000
right

17089
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:11,000
hand

17090
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:11,000
corner

17091
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:11,000
click

17092
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,000
on

17093
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:12,000
create

17094
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,000
click

17095
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:13,000
on

17096
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,000
droplet

17097
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,000
you

17098
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:15,000
could

17099
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:15,000
do

17100
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:15,000
an

17101
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,000
app

17102
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:16,000
platform

17103
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:16,000
that's

17104
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,000
technically

17105
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:17,000
going

17106
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:17,000
to

17107
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:17,000
be

17108
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,000
cheaper

17109
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:18,000
but

17110
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:18,000
it's

17111
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:18,000
a

17112
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:18,000
lot

17113
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,000
harder

17114
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:19,000
to

17115
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:19,000
get

17116
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:19,000
everything

17117
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,000
set

17118
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:20,000
up

17119
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:20,000
properly

17120
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,000
so

17121
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:21,000
i'm

17122
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:21,000
just

17123
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:21,000
going

17124
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:21,000
to

17125
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:21,000
do

17126
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:21,000
a

17127
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,000
droplet

17128
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:22,000
for

17129
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:22,000
right

17130
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:22,000
now

17131
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:26,000
and

17132
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:26,000
so

17133
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,000
we

17134
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:27,000
can

17135
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:27,000
pick

17136
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,000
what

17137
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:28,000

17138
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:28,000

in

17143
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:30,000
so

17144
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:30,000
right

17145
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:30,000
here

17146
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:30,000
i'm

17147
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:30,000

i'm

17596
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:51,000
doing

01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,000

17602
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,000
now

17603
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:56,000
since

17604
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:56,000
this

17605
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:56,000
is

17606
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,000
going

17607
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:57,000
to

17608
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:57,000
be

17609
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:57,000
a

01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:57,000
tutorial

17611
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,000
i

17612
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,000
should

17613
01:51:59,000 --> 01:51:59,000
probably

17614
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,000
just

17615
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:00,000
do

17616
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:00,000
ubuntu

17617
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,000
with

17618
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:01,000
the

17619
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:01,000
four

17620
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:01,000
because

17621
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,000
odds

17622
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:02,000
are

17623
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:03,000
you're

17624
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:03,000
not

17625
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:03,000
going

17626
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,000
to

17627
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:04,000
have

17628
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:04,000
the

17629
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,000
funding

17630
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:05,000
to

17631
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:05,000
do

17632
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:05,000
this

17633
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:06,000
or

17634
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:06,000
something

17635
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:06,000
like

17636
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:06,000
that

17637
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,000
so

17638
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:07,000
we'll

17639
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:07,000
try

17640
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:07,000
the

17641
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:07,000
four

17642
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,000
we

17643
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:08,000
might

17644
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:08,000
have

17645
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:08,000
to

17646
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:08,000
upgrade

17647
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,000
to

17648
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:09,000
six

17649
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:09,000
we'll

17650
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:09,000
see

17651
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,000
and

17652
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:10,000
then

17653
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,000
you

17654
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:11,000
can

17655
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:11,000
see

17656
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:12,000
here

17657
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:12,000
that

17658
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:12,000
you

17659
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:12,000
can

17660
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,000
add

17661
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:13,000

17663
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,000
which

17664
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:14,000
will

17665
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:14,000
allow

17666
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:14,000

17667
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:14,000
to

17668
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,000
expand

17669
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:15,000

01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:18,000
it's

17682
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:18,000
fine

17683
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,000

you

17688
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:20,000

you

then

18414
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:56,000
we

18415
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,000
need

01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:57,000

01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:10,000
basically

18440
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:11,000

01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,000
that's

01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:16,000
right

18450
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:16,000
there

18451
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:16,000
so

18452
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,000
basically

18453
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:17,000
linux

aggressive

18463
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:22,000
so

18464
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,000
you

18465
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:23,000
need

18466
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:23,000

01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:23,000
sure

18469
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,000
that

18470
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,000
you

18471
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:25,000
keep

18472
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:25,000
that

18473
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:26,000

18474
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:26,000

sense

18480
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:28,000
so

18481
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,000
uh

18482
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,000

you

01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:35,000
that's

18503
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:35,000

so

18511
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,000
then

18512
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:38,000
we

18513
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:38,000

01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:41,000

02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:03,000

02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:03,000

immediately

18922
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:06,000
so

18923
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:07,000
e

18924

18928
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,000
we

18929
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:10,000
will

18930
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:10,000

18933
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:11,000
hopefully

18934
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:11,000
this

18935
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:12,000
doesn't

18936
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:12,000

all

18939
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:15,000
right

18940
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:15,000
so

18941
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:15,000
we

18942
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:15,000
have

02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:16,000
no

18948
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,000
so

18949
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:20,000
all

18950
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:20,000
right

18951
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:20,000
so

18952
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:20,000
i

18953
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:20,000

i

18955
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:21,000

02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:21,000
it

18957
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:21,000
out

18958
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,000
basically

18959
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:22,000
there

18960
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:22,000
is

18961
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:22,000
an

02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:22,000
issue

18963
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,000
with

18964
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:23,000
the

18965
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:23,000

18966
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:24,000
for

18967
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,000
i

18968
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:25,000
think

18969
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:25,000
it

18970
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:25,000
was

18971
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,000
this

18973
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:27,000
here

18974
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:27,000
so

18975
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:28,000
don't

18976
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:28,000
worry

18977
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,000
just

18978
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:29,000
copy

18979
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:30,000

02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:30,000
i

18981
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,000

02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:00,000
we'll

19212
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:00,000
hit

02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,000

it's

try

it

19224
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:03,000
it

19225
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:03,000

that

02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:03,000
it

my

19235
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:06,000
guess

19236
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:06,000
is

02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:07,000
something

02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
so

19243
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:09,000
let's

19244
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:09,000
see

02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:13,000
we

it

02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:15,000

we

02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:21,000

we'll

we

it

02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:42,000

we

02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:21,000
that's

19430
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:21,000
going

19431
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:21,000

19437
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:22,000
so

19618
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:37,000
and

19619
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:37,000
bring

19620
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:38,000
them

19621
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:38,000
over

19622
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:38,000
to

19623
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:39,000

19625
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:40,000

19630
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:42,000
so

19631
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:42,000
thankfully

19632
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:42,000
we

19633
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:42,000
can

19634
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,000
just

19635
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:43,000
copy

19636
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:43,000

19637
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:43,000
paste

19638
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:43,000
this

19639
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:44,000

and

19644
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:47,000
it'll

19645
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:47,000
be

we

19655
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:52,000
should

19656
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:52,000
be

we're

19666
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:56,000
lucky

19667
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:56,000
so

19668
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:57,000
what

you'll

19681
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:03,000

it's

here

19698
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:08,000

we

19700
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,000

02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,000
hopefully

19712
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:13,000

02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,000
it's

going

19719
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:15,000
to

02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:15,000
be

19721
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:15,000
really

19722
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:15,000
tight

19723
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,000

19724
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:16,000

know

02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:16,000

02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:16,000
this

19728
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,000
is

19729
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:17,000
going

work

19732
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:17,000
we're

19733
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:18,000
probably

19734
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:18,000
going

19735
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:18,000
to

19736
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:18,000
need

19737
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:18,000

we

02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:19,000
see

19743
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:20,000
so

19744
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:20,000
we'll

19745
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:20,000
let

02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:21,000
this

it

19756
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:23,000
looks

19757
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:24,000

it

19759
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:24,000

like

19820
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:52,000
it's

19821
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,000
going

19822
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:53,000
to

19823
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:53,000
so

19824
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:54,000
now

19825
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:54,000
we

19826
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:54,000
got

19827
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:54,000
to

19828
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:54,000
figure

19829
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:55,000
out

19830
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:55,000
is

19831
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:56,000
it

19832
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:56,000
this

19833
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,000
guy's

19834
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:57,000
fault

19835
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,000
it

19836
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:58,000
looks

19837
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:58,000
like

19838
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:59,000
this

19839
02:06:59,000 --> 02:06:59,000
is

19840
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:00,000
running

19841
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:00,000
so

19842
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:01,000
my

19843
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:02,000
question

19844
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:03,000
is

19845
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:04,000
server

19846
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:04,000
is

19847
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:04,000
ready

19848
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,000
to

19849
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:05,000
receive

19850
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:05,000
web

19851
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:06,000
requests

19852
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:06,000
so

19853
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:06,000
it

19854
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:06,000
did

19855
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,000
spin

19856
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:07,000
up

19857
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:08,000
properly

19858
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:08,000
it

19859
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:08,000
started

19860
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:08,000
the

19861
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:08,000
rule

19862
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:09,000
manager

19863
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,000
properly

19864
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:11,000
so

19865
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:11,000
that's

19866
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:12,000
good

19867
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:12,000
news

19868
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,000
oh

19869
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:13,000
you

19870
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:13,000
can

19871
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:13,000
see

19872
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:13,000
it

19873
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:14,000
is

19874
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:14,000
just

19875
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:15,000
absolutely

19876
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:15,000
chugging

19877
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:15,000
though

19878
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:16,000
so

19879
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:16,000
if

19880
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:16,000
we

19881
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:16,000
take

19882
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:16,000
a

19883
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,000
look

19884
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:17,000
at

19885
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:17,000
our

19886
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:18,000
youtube

19887
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:19,000
docker

19888
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:19,000
container

19889
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:20,000
let's

19890
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:21,000
see

19891
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:21,000
it

19892
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:21,000
looks

19893
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,000
like

19894
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:22,000
our

19895
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:22,000
cpu

19896
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,000
utilization

19897
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:23,000
is

19898
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:23,000
pretty

19899
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:24,000
high

19900
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:24,000
our

19901
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,000
disk

19902
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:25,000
io

19903
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:25,000
is

19904
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:26,000
relatively

19905
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:26,000
high

19906
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:26,000
as

19907
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:26,000
well

19908
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:27,000
we

19909
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:27,000
probably

19910
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:28,000
need

19911
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:28,000
to

19912
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:28,000
upgrade

19913
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,000
to

19914
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:29,000
have

19915
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:30,000
one

19916
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:30,000
gig

19917
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:30,000
of

19918
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:30,000
ram

19919
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,000
but

19920
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,000
at

19921
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,000
least

19922
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:33,000
it

19923
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:33,000
is

19924
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:34,000
running

19925
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:35,000
so

19926
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:36,000
there

19927
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:36,000
is

19928
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:36,000
that

19929
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,000
the

19930
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:37,000
question

19931
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:38,000
is

19932
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:39,000
so

19933
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:39,000
i

19934
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:39,000
was

19935
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:39,000
able

19936
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:39,000
to

19937
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:39,000
get

19938
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:39,000
it

19939
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:40,000
to

19940
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:40,000
stop

19941
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:40,000
so

19942
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:40,000
what

19943
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:41,000
we'll

19944
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:41,000
do

19945
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:41,000
is

19946
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:41,000
we'll

19947
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:42,000
close

19948
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:42,000
it

19949
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:42,000
we'll

19950
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:42,000
go

19951
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:42,000

19954
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:43,000
we'll

19955
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:44,000
go

19956
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:44,000
over

19957
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:44,000
to

19958
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:45,000
upgrade

19959

19960
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:46,000
and

19961
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:46,000
then

19962
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:46,000
we'll

19963
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:46,000
go

19964
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:47,000
ahead

19965
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:47,000
and

19966
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:47,000
just

19967
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:47,000
upgrade

19968
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:48,000
that

19969
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:48,000
up

19970
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:48,000

19973
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,000

edition

19979
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:52,000
so

19980
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:52,000
we'll

19981
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:52,000
do

19982
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:53,000
that

19983
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:54,000
and

19984
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:54,000
then

19985
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:54,000
we'll

19986
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,000
click

19989
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:57,000
when

19990
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:58,000
it's

19991
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:58,000
going

19992
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:58,000
to

19993
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:58,000
ask

19994
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:58,000
us

19995
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:58,000
to

19996
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:59,000
turn

19997
02:07:59,000 --> 02:07:59,000
off

19998
02:07:59,000 --> 02:07:59,000
our

19999

droplet

20000
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:00,000
so

20001
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:00,000
we'll

20002
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:00,000
go

20003
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:00,000
up

20004
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:00,000
to

20005
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,000
power

20006
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:01,000
we'll

20007
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:02,000
power

20008
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:02,000
it

20009
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:02,000
off

20010
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:02,000
because

20011
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:02,000
there's

20012
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:03,000
nothing

20013
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:03,000

20014
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:03,000
here

20015
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:03,000
anyway

20016
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,000
so

20017
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:04,000
we

20018
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:04,000
can

20019
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:04,000
just

it's

20393
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:19,000
we're

starting

02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:22,000
my

20405
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,000
guess

02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:23,000

it

02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:24,000

lack

20415

had

20420
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:26,000
so

02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:26,000
let's

02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:29,000

it

20696
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:07,000
would

that's

02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:12,000

02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:26,000
you

20914
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:27,000

02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,000
we

20931
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:33,000

02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:36,000
i

20939
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:36,000

think

20951
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:41,000
that's

20952
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:41,000
because

20953
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:42,000

02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:36,000
same

21105
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:36,000
game

21106
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:36,000
at

21107
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:36,000
the

21108
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:37,000
same

21109
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:37,000
time

21110
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:38,000
over

21111
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:38,000
the

21112
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:38,000
internet

21113
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:39,000
using

21114
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:39,000
our

21115
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:40,000
nakama

21116
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:40,000
instance

21117
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:41,000
now

21118
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:41,000
you

21119
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:41,000
can

21120
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:41,000
see

21121
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:42,000
here

21122
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:42,000
that

21123
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:42,000
there

21124
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,000
is

21125
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:43,000
a

21126
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:43,000
little

21127
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:43,000
bit

21128
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:43,000
of

21129
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:44,000
lag

21130
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:44,000
and

21131
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:44,000
i

21132
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:44,000
think

21133
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:45,000
the

21134
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:45,000
reason

21135
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:45,000
for

21136
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:45,000
that

21137
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:45,000
is

21138
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:46,000
because

21139
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:46,000
we're

21140
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,000
flooding

21141
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:47,000
the

21142
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:48,000
actual

21143
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:48,000
nakama

21144
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:49,000
instance

21145
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:50,000
because

21146
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:51,000
it

21147
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:52,000
has

21148
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,000
a

21149
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:53,000
bunch

21150
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:53,000
of

21151
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:53,000
data

21152
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:54,000
that

21153
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:54,000
it's

21154
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:54,000
passing

21155
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:54,000
through

21156
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,000
so

21157
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:55,000
we

21158
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:55,000
should

21159
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:55,000
probably

21160
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:56,000
figure

21161
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:56,000
out

21162
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:56,000
a

21163
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:56,000
better

21164
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:56,000
way

21165
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:56,000
to

21166
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,000
optimize

21167
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:57,000
this

21168
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:58,000
but

21169
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:58,000
at

21170
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:58,000
least

21171
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:58,000
we

21172
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:59,000
have

21173
02:14:59,000 --> 02:14:59,000
it

21174
02:14:59,000 --> 02:14:59,000
working

21175
02:14:59,000 --> 02:14:59,000
for

21176
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:00,000
now

21177
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,000
so

21178
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:01,000
at

21179
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:02,000
this

21180
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:02,000
point

21181
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:02,000
we've

21182
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:03,000
gone

21183
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:03,000
through

21184
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:03,000
quite

21185
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:04,000
a

21186
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:04,000
few

21187
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:04,000
things

21188
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:05,000
we

21189
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:05,000
talked

21190
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:05,000
about

21191
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:06,000
groups

21192
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:06,000
we

21193
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:06,000
talked

21194
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:07,000
about

we
