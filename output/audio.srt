00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hey  guys  this  is  Mitch  with

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Fineboy  CGI  and  today  we're  going

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
to  continue  our  Nakama  tutorial  series

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
where  I  take  you  from  zero

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
to  understanding  all  the  fundamentals  of

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Nakama  and  in  this  video  we're

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
going  to  talk  about  how  to

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
do  groups  so  that's  going  to

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
allow  you  to  add  users  to

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
like  a  guild

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
or  like  a  group  setting  then

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
we're  going  to  talk  about  doing

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
chats  and  chatting  between  each  other

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
so  sending  messages  to  each  other

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and  finally  due  to  popular  requests

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm  going  to  talk  about  how

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,000
to

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
host  your  Nakama  instance  out  on

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
the  internet  so  that  you  can

20
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
play  games  with  your  friends  or

21
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
of

22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
course  you  can  release  your  game

23
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
out  to  make  it  into  a

24
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
multiplayer  game  so  that's  what  I

25
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
have  in

26
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
store  for  you  guys  today  so

27
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
let's  go  ahead  and  get  started

28
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
all  right  so  this  tutorial  assumes

29
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
that  you

30
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
already  completed  the  previous  tutorial  where

31
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
we  actually  integrated  Nakama  for  the

32
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
most  part

33
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
so  this  one's  going  to  be

34
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
going  over  more  of  the  features

35
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and  things  like  that  that  are

36
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
available

37
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
to  you  so  let's  go  ahead

38
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and  get  started  with  that  and

39
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
the  first  thing  we're  going  to

40
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
talk  about  is

41
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
creating  groups  so  groups  are  basically

42
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
like  a  guild  or  a  team

43
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
of  people  that  want  to  play

44
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
with  each

45
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
other  multiple  times  not  necessarily  as

46
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
a  party  but  as  an  actual

47
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
group  so  after  the  game  is

48
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
ended  and  everything  is  done  you

49
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
still  have  access  to  that  group

50
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
of  people  so  the  first  thing

51
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,000
that

52
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm  going  to  do  is  I'm

53
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
going  to  come  in  here  and

54
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm  going  to  hide  our  friends

55
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000
section  because  we're

56
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
actually  running  out  of  space  here

57
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and  I  really  should  name  all

58
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
of  these  but  that's  probably  going

59
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
to  break  all  of  my  code

60
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
so  we'll  go  ahead  and  just

61
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
hide  that  panel  go  ahead  and

62
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
add  in  a  new  panel

63
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
like  so  I'm  going  to  go

64
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
over  here  make  it  about  this

65
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
big  give  or  take  I'm  going

66
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
to  right  click  add

67
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
a  child  node  we'll  add  in

68
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
a  label  like  that  we're  going

69
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
to  make  it  about  this  big

70
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and  we'll  have  a

71
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
name  parameter  there  we'll  go  ahead

72
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and  duplicate  it  and  say  description

73
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and  then  we'll  come  in  here

74
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
right  click  add  in  a  child

75
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
node  and  we'll  add  in  a

76
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
line  edit  like  so

77
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and  we'll  make  it  about  this

78
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
big  give  or  take  we'll  control

79
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
duplicate  that  and  we'll  make  it

80
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,000
about

81
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
this  big  I  mean  technically  the

82
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
description  should  be  a  little  bit

83
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
longer  but  that's  okay  we'll  make

84
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
it  work  for  what  we're  going

85
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
to  do  so  that's  fine  and

86
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'll  just  kind  of  organize  this

87
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
properly  then

88
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
we'll  add  in  a  button  and

89
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
this  button  is  going  to  allow

90
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
us  to  create  a  group  now

91
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm  going  to  need

92
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
multiple  buttons  but  for  right  now

93
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
we'll  just  do  one  I  think

94
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
so  we'll  go  ahead  and  say

95
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
create  group

96
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
like  so  and  I'll  probably  need

97
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
to  make  this  panel  larger  to

98
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
be  honest  I'm  running  out  of

99
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,000
space  here

100
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
so  we'll  go  ahead  and  just

101
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
make  this  a  touch  bit  bigger

102
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
like  so  now  when  we  want

103
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
to  create  a  group

104
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
all  we  have  to  do  is

105
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
if  we  grab  this  button  name

106
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
it  create  group  like  so  we'll

107
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
go  into  our  node  button

108
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
down  and  we'll  hook  that  to

109
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
our  control  node  just  like  that

110
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
now  you'll  see  when  I  hook

111
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
it  to  the

112
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
control  node  it  should  create

113
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
a  create  group  button  down  function

114
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
it  looks  like  I  already  did

115
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
this  in  a  previous  section  so

116
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm  going

117
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
to  go  ahead  and  get  rid

118
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
of  that  that's  my  fault  that

119
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
caught  me  off  guard  real  quick

120
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
but  to  create  a

121
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
group  all  we  have  to  do

122
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
is  say  client  dot  create  group

123
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
async  and  then  we  can  pass

124
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
in  our  session

125
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
like  so  and  then  we  have

126
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
to  pass  in  a  name  now

127
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
the  name  is  whatever  the  name

128
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
is  that  we  put  as  our

129
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
line

130
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
edit  now  if  we  take  a

131
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
look  we  have  our  name  right

132
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
here  so  we'll  say  group  name

133
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and  then  group  description

134
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
like  so  and  then  we'll  go

135
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
back  to  our  script  and  we'll

136
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
do  dollar  sign  group  name  comma

137
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
or  dot  text

138
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
comma  dollar  sign  group  description  dot

139
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
text  comma  and  then  you'll  see

140
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
that  they  have  the  option  for

141
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
an  avatar  url  now  you  don't

142
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
have  to  supply  one  but  you

143
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
can  and  that's  really  cool  because

144
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
it  basically  would

145
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
allow  you  to  have  some  kind

146
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
of  url  for  an  image  that

147
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
you  could  load  for  their  group

148
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,000
so  I'm  going  to  put

149
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
that  as  empty  comma  and  then

150
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
you'll  see  that  they  have  a

151
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
language  so  we'll  say  their  main

152
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
language  is

153
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
en  it  doesn't  really  matter  necessarily

154
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
but  it  is  a  thing  that

155
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
exists  and  actually  I  need  to

156
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm  messing

157
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
up  my  little  things  here  we'll

158
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
put  an  empty  url  we'll  put

159
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
a  en  for  the  avatar  title

160
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and  then  you

161
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
can  choose  whether  or  not  it's

162
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
an  open  or  if  it's  not

163
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
so  an  open  means  if  it's

164
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
a  public  group  so  if

165
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
people  can  actually  see  it  and

166
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
index  it  for  other  people  so

167
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
if  you  say  false  then  it's

168
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000
a  private  group

169
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
so  if  you  don't  want  it

170
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
to  be  listable  which  we'll  discuss

171
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
listing  in  a  little  bit  but

172
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
it  allows  you  to

173
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
basically  say  is  this  a  listable

174
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
group  so  I'm  going  to  say

175
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
true  because  it  makes  sense  to

176
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,000
have  a  listable

177
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
group  and  then  you  can  have

178
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
a  max  number  of  members  now

179
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
once  this  is  set  you  cannot

180
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
change  it

181
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
so  make  sure  you  set  it

182
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
to  a  value  that  you  want

183
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
so  if  a  guild  can  only

184
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
have  64  members  then  you  set

185
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
it  to  64  if  it's  100

186
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
members  then  you  can  set  it

187
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
to  100  so  in  my  case

188
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm  going  to  say  32  just

189
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,000
because

190
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
32  is  just  a  good  round

191
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
number  now  after  that  there  is

192
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
nothing  else  that  we  can  do

193
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
so  we'll  go  ahead  and

194
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
just  say  32  now  typically  this

195
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
also  returns  a  group  api  so

196
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
you  could  say  var  group  is

197
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,000
equal  to

198
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
await  client  asynchronous  and  then  we

199
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
can  just  go  ahead  and  print

200
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
out  that  group  now  you  don't

201
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,000
have

202
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
to  do  this  but  it  is

203
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
a  way  to  get  a  hold

204
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
of  that  object  if  that  makes

205
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
sense  so  if  you  needed  to

206
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,000
go

207
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
ahead  and  make  your  group  you

208
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
know  visible  or  not  visible  or

209
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
something  like  that  you  could  do

210
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,000
that  right

211
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
here  so  now  if  we  go

212
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
ahead  and  make  sure  that  our

213
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
nakama  instance  is  running  so  if

214
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I  take  a  look  at

215
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
my  containers  you  can  see  it

216
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
is  actually  running  so  there  we

217
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
go  we'll  go  ahead  and  hit

218
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
play

219
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and  then  we're  going  to  go

220
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
ahead  and  submit  we're  going  to

221
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
connect  to  our  game  we're  going

222
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,000
to  call  our

223
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
group  test  group  description  this  is

224
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
our  test  group  and  we'll  click

225
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
create  now  you'll  see  that  we

226
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
have

227
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
a  error  group  name  must  be

228
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
set  so  I  must  have  messed

229
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
up  on  my  group  name  so

230
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
let's  take  a  look

231
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
panel  5  group  name  oh  I

232
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
made  a  mistake  because  this  is

233
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
the  original  panel  I  did  some

234
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
recording  earlier

235
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
that  um  I  didn't  keep  it

236
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
but  I  never  actually  removed  that

237
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
panel  so  we'll  change  this  to

238
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
panel

239
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
6  and  then  we'll  go  from

240
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
there  so  we'll  refresh  this  and

241
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
try  this  one  more  time  that's

242
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
my  fault  so

243
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
we'll  submit  test  group  this  is

244
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
a  test  group  create  group  and

245
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
you'll  see  that  we  get  a

246
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
success

247
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
right  there  so  now  I'm  going

248
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
to  navigate  to  127  nakama  console

249
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
right  here  so  we'll  go  to

250
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
our  127

251
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
7351  and  then  we  will  connect

252
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
into  our  nakama  group  if  we

253
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
go  to  groups  you  will  see

254
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
there  is  our  test

255
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
group  and  you  can  see  this

256
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
is  what  we  have  if  we

257
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
take  a  look  at  our  members

258
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
you  can  see  that  there  is

259
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
a  super  admin  so  what  in

260
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
the  world  is  a  super  admin

261
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
well  a  super  admin  is  a

262
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
person  that  has  full  control

263
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
over  that  group  so  this  person

264
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
jj  rbv  w  e  x  k

265
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
i  is  a  super  admin  of

266
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
that  group  so  what  that  means

267
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
is  that  they  have  the  ability

268
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
to  delete  that  group  and  when

269
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
you  are  a  super  admin  you

270
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
have  full  control  over  that  group

271
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
there  are  four  different  membership  states

272
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
there's  super  admin  which  means  that

273
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
you  are  basically  god  you  can

274
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
do  whatever  you  want  to  this

275
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,000
group

276
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
you  can  delete  people  you  can

277
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
do  whatever  you  want  basically  you

278
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
can  delete  the  group  and  that's

279
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
a  big  thing  admin  which  allows

280
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
you  to  update  your  group  and

281
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
allow  you  to  accept  kick  promote

282
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
delete  ban  or  promote  members  and

283
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
then  they  have  members  which  allows

284
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
you  to  actually  have  a  regular

285
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
group  member  they  don't  have  the

286
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
ability  to  do  anything  they  cannot

287
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
accept  join  requests  stuff  like  that

288
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
and  then  they  have  the  join

289
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
request  mode  which  basically  is  a

290
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
when  a  user  wants  to  join

291
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
they  need  to  be  accepted  so

292
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
you  have  to  say  yes  i

293
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
will  accept  you  as  a  part

294
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
of  a  group  and  that's  how

295
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
you  know  the  different  states  if

296
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
that  makes  sense  so  if  we

297
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
go  to  our  user  management  we

298
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
look  for  the  jjr  person  if

299
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
we  go  into  accounts  i  have

300
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
a  bunch  of  usernames  here  because

301
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
i've  been  doing  a  lot  of

302
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
testing  on  my  end  but  if

303
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
i  look  for  jj  let  me

304
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
see  i  think  it's  jj  let

305
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
me  take  a  look

306
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
members  name  jj  members  name  jjrb

307
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
jjrb  well  that  person  let  me

308
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
see  jj  i  have  71  accounts

309
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
so  you  can  see  i  have

310
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
a  bunch  of  accounts  because  i've

311
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
been  doing  a  lot  of  testing

312
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
on  my  end  for  my  own

313
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
stuff  and  nakama  is  being  difficult

314
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
so  let  me  refresh  jjrb

315
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
well  apparently  jj  doesn't  exist  within

316
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
my  vast  number  of  people  so

317
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
i'm  not  sure  why  it  did

318
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
that  but  that's  okay  there's  probably

319
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
a  master  account  that  it's  using

320
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
actually  it's  right  here  jjrb  right

321
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
here  so  i'm  not  sure  why

322
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
it  used  this  specific  one  unless

323
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
i  logged  in

324
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
and  created  it  with  device  authentication

325
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
which  is  possible  but  that's  okay

326
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
we'll  figure  that  out  in  a

327
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
minute  but  that's  basically  how  we

328
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
create  a  group  now  you  can

329
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
see  we  also  printed  out  a

330
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
group  as  well  so

331
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
you  can  see  here  we  have

332
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
our  creator  id  which  is  right

333
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
here  the  creator  id  is  db

334
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
so  this  is  the  creator  id

335
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
so

336
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
our  creator  is  jj  so  we

337
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
must  have  logged  in  with  device

338
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
authentication  which  means  i  probably  didn't

339
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
reset  my  client  authentication  stuff  so

340
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
let  me  take  a  look  at

341
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
that  real  quick  my  apologies  i

342
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
um  may  not

343
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
have  reset  some  of  my  code

344
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
so  that  it  worked  properly  did

345
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
user  authentication  instead  of  our  um

346
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
device  authentication  so  my  guess  is

347
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
that's  probably  what  it  is  so

348
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
if  i  go  to  log  in

349
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
yeah  right  here  i'm

350
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
doing  a  unique  device  id  right

351
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
here  and  i'm  logging  in  with

352
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
that  socket  connection  so  that's  what's

353
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,000
going

354
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
on  here  so  what  i'm  gonna

355
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
do  is  i'm  gonna  control  k

356
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
to  comment  that  out  and  i'm

357
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
going  to  go  ahead  and

358
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
log  in  with  my  username  so

359
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
now  i'm  gonna  go  in  here

360
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and  i'll  reset  this  because  it's

361
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,000
going  to  be

362
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
kind  of  difficult  to  have  a

363
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
group  that  uh  exists  that's  not

364
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
tied  to  an  actual  user  so

365
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,000
i'll  go  ahead

366
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
and  do  that  i'll  refresh  and

367
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
then  we're  going  to  recreate  that

368
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
group  just  because  it  makes  more

369
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
sense

370
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
so  i'll  say  test  group  description

371
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
this  is  a  test  group  and

372
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
we'll  go  ahead  and  create  that

373
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
group  now  if  we

374
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
take  a  look  at  our  nakama

375
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
console  you  will  see  that  because

376
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
this  was  created  by  test  that

377
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
person  is  the

378
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
super  admin  so  whoever  creates  the

379
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
group  gets  super  admin  status  now

380
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
in  order  to  add  users  it's

381
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
actually

382
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
relatively  easy  all  we  need  to

383
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
do  is  go  in  to  our

384
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
project  here  and  you  can  see

385
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
right  here  we  have  the

386
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
ability  to  create  a  group  so

387
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
we'll  just  go  ahead  and  duplicate

388
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
this  and  we  will  come  down

389
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
here  and  we'll

390
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
right  click  disconnect  we're  going  to

391
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
go  in  here  connect  and  say

392
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
on  add  user  we'll  say  add

393
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
underscore

394
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
user  underscore  to  group  like  so

395
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
button  down  and  we'll  go  ahead

396
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and  connect  that  and  i'm  going

397
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,000
to

398
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
rename  this  to  add  user  to

399
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
group  so  with  this  for  us

400
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
to  be  able  to  add  users

401
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
to  group  it's  actually

402
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
really  really  easy  all  we  need

403
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
to  do  is  pass  in  the

404
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
group  id  that  we  want  to

405
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
add  ourselves  to  so

406
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
unfortunately  we  have  to  actually  pull

407
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
that  user  identifier  so  if  you

408
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
look  at  this  you  can  see

409
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
inside  of  our  groups  we  have

410
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
a  user  id  right  here  this

411
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
is  the  identifier  that  we  need

412
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
to  give  them

413
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
to  be  able  to  be  able

414
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
to  add  ourselves  to  that  group

415
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
so  if  we  come  in  here

416
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
and  copy  this  we  can

417
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
come  down  here  go  back  into

418
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
godot  and  then  basically  just  say

419
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
await  client  dot  join  group  async

420
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and  then  do  session  comma  and

421
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
then  we'll  just  pass  in  that

422
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
group  identifier  now  if  we  come

423
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
in  here  and

424
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
we  hit  play  you'll  see  in

425
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
a  second  we'll  go  ahead  and

426
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
log  in  as  test  two  we

427
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
will  type  test  i  mean  it

428
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
doesn't  really  matter  and  you  can

429
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
see  the  text  here  is  wrong

430
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
but  that's  okay  we'll  click  create

431
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,000
group

432
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
which  is  technically  add  group  and

433
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
you'll  see  that  we  get  an

434
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
authorization  token  right  here  we  got

435
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,000
a  404

436
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
group  not  found  so  my  guess

437
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
is  that  i  have  the  wrong

438
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
identifier  go  to  group  group  id

439
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
i  do  so  we'll  go

440
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
ahead  and  copy  that  and  we'll

441
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
go  back  here  we'll  change  this

442
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
guy  like  so  paste  ctrl  s

443
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
and  the  nice

444
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
thing  about  godot  is  that  if

445
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
you  uh  just  change  the  code

446
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
in  here  you  can  just  click

447
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
that  and  you  can  see

448
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
that  it  should  work  and  that's

449
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
because  godot  is  a  non -compiled

450
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
language  so  you  can  actually  get

451
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,000
away

452
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
with  changing  it  and  re -executing

453
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
the  code  so  now  if  you

454
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
look  at  members  you  can  see

455
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
test  two  is  now  a

456
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
member  now  you  might  be  wondering

457
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
okay  so  anybody  can  join  my

458
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
group  yes  anyone  can  join  your

459
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
group  as

460
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
long  as  it  is  public  if

461
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
it's  not  public  then  you  have

462
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
to  be  approved  so  that's  where

463
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
the  difference

464
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
comes  in  so  if  i  come

465
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
in  here  i  remove  test  two

466
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
i  go  to  details  and  i

467
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
change  this  to  not  open  and

468
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,000
i

469
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
save  it  now  if  i  go

470
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
ahead  and  i  hit  create  group

471
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
or  i  guess  connect  to  the

472
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
group  you  can  see  that  there

473
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
is  a  join  request  and  that

474
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
means  that  i  have  to  approve

475
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
that  before  they  can  be  a

476
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
part  of  the  group

477
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
so  the  question  is  how  do

478
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
you  actually  accept  that  join  request

479
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
well  to  accept  a  join  request

480
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
what  you

481
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
need  to  do  is  you  need

482
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
to  come  in  here  and  actually

483
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
code  out  a  small  subroutine  first

484
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,000
thing  first  i'm

485
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
going  to  come  in  here  and

486
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
change  this  to  add  join  group

487
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
like  that  and  then  i'm  going

488
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
to  go  ahead  and

489
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
duplicate  this  guy  drag  this  guy

490
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
down  like  so  and  i'm  going

491
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
to  say  add  user

492
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
to  group  like  so  and  if

493
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
i  just  hit  enter  that  will

494
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
help  with  formatting  this  button  a

495
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,000
little  bit  better

496
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
now  we'll  pull  this  name  parameter

497
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
to  allow  ourselves  to  actually  you

498
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
know  go  from  there  and  this

499
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,000
should

500
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
probably  be  called  join  group  so

501
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
it'll  be  fine  i  guess  for

502
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
now  but  it's  just  something  i'm

503
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,000
not  a  huge

504
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
fan  of  but  that's  okay  so

505
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
we'll  go  ahead  and  click  node

506
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
right  click  disconnect  connect  and  then

507
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,000
we'll  go

508
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
ahead  and  create  that  little  function

509
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
there  now  to  accept  a  join

510
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
request  you  need  to  be  able

511
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,000
to  list

512
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
your  groups  or  your  users  inside

513
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
of  that  group  and  that's  really

514
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
easy  to  do  we  can  basically

515
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
just  say  var

516
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
users  is  equal  to  await  client

517
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,000
dot  list  group  users  async  like

518
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
that  we  can  pass  in  our

519
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
session  token

520
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and  then  we  can  pass  in

521
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
our  group  id  now  our  group

522
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
id  is  right  here  so  we'll

523
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
go  ahead  and  copy  that  and

524
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
paste  it  and  then  we'll  hit

525
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
comma  and  then  we  can  actually

526
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
have  a  different  state  so  this

527
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,000
is  where  that

528
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
one  two  or  i  guess  zero

529
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
one  two  and  three  is  useful

530
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
if  you  wanted  to  you  could

531
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
list  everyone

532
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
that  is  a  member  of  the

533
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
group  everyone  that's  waiting  to  join

534
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
the  group  and  anybody  that's  a

535
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
super  user  or  an  admin  just

536
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
by  changing  this  from  zero  through

537
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
three  in  our  case  we're  going

538
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,000
to  be

539
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
grabbing  all  the  people  that  are

540
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
awaiting  for  their  joins  you  can

541
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
see  the  state  is  three  so

542
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,000
we  will  go

543
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
ahead  and  do  that  and  then

544
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
all  we  need  to  do  is

545
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
come  in  here  and  say  for

546
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
user  in

547
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
users  dot  group  underscore  users  colon

548
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,000
var  you  is  equal  to  user

549
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
dot  user  and  then  await  client

550
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
dot  add  group  users  async

551
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
async  pass  in  our  session  right

552
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
here  comma  what  our  group  id

553
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
is  which  in  this  case  is

554
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,000
this  guy  right

555
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
here  so  we'll  pass  that  guy

556
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
in  comma  and  then  we'll  pass

557
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
in  you  and  now  we'll  go

558
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
ahead  and  add

559
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
that  person  so  now  if  i

560
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
refresh  and  i  go  add  user

561
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
to  group  so  if  i  submit

562
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
i  log  in  as  the  test

563
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
user

564
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
and  i  click  add  user  to

565
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
group  you'll  see  that  we  got

566
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
an  error  here  unable  to  convert

567
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
uh  argument  three

568
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
to  pack  string  array  so  you

569
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
is  not  correct  so  let's  take

570
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
a  look  at  what  you  is

571
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
real  quick  i  don't  think

572
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
there's  really  an  easy  way  to

573
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
handle  this  without  going  bracket  bracket

574
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
and  then  passing  in  dot  id

575
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
and  then  just  using  their  id

576
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
i  think  that  that  will  work

577
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
it's  not  the  most  ideal  way

578
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
to  fix  it

579
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
but  if  i  log  in  i

580
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
hit  add  user  you  should  see

581
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
a  nice  request  here  and  then

582
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
we'll  go  ahead  and  refresh

583
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
this  and  you  can  see  that

584
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
they  are  now  a  member  and

585
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
that's  because  when  we  built  the

586
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
group  we  made  it  a

587
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
private  group  now  you  might  be

588
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
wondering  is  there  a  way  for

589
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
us  to  make  a  group  private

590
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
or  public

591
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
through  code  right  so  that  way

592
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
it  doesn't  have  to  happen  immediately

593
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
on  start  and  the  answer  to

594
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,000
your

595
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
question  is  yes  you  can  actually

596
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
do  that  pretty  easily  all  you

597
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
need  to  do  is  come  in

598
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
here  go  in  here

599
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
let's  grab  this  make  it  slightly

600
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
bigger  again  the  group  section  is

601
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
going  to  be  very  large  for

602
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,000
this  so

603
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
we'll  add  in  a  check  box

604
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
here  like  so  and  we'll  call

605
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
it  open  like  that  and  then

606
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
we're  going  to  add

607
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
in  a  toggle  switch  so  i'll

608
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
just  put  this  right  here  for

609
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
right  now  we'll  call  it  open

610
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
that's  fine

611
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
and  then  we'll  go  ahead  and

612
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
say  on  button  down  or  i

613
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
guess  on  toggled  we'll  toggle  this

614
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
on  our  control

615
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
node  and  basically  when  it  gets

616
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
toggled  it'll  show  you  yes  or

617
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
no  so  we'll  say  await  client

618
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
dot  update

619
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
group  asynchronously  we'll  pass  in  our

620
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
session  token  comma  our  group  id

621
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
which  is  this  guy  right  here

622
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
and  we'll  talk  about  how  to

623
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
get  that  group  id  uh  through

624
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
code  in  a  second  comma  and

625
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,000
then

626
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
the  name  of  the  group  which

627
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
i'll  pass  in  null  because  i

628
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
don't  want  to  change  it  and

629
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,000
then  we'll

630
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
pass  in  toggled  underscore  on  like

631
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
that  and  you'll  see  that  if

632
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
i  come  in  here  and  i

633
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
submit  and  then  i

634
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
click  open  you'll  see  if  we

635
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
refresh  our  nakama  instance  here  so

636
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
we'll  refresh  this  page  you'll  see

637
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
it's  not  open  if  we  close

638
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
it  it  should  hopefully  do  it

639
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
real  quick  maybe  not  let's  take

640
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,000
a  look  let's

641
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
do  a  break  point  here  i

642
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
could  just  be  crazy  so  if

643
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
i  come  in  here  toggle  response

644
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
code  400  spec  specify  at

645
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
least  one  field  to  update  let's

646
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
see  if  we  come  in  here

647
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
comma  p  name  p  description

648
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
variant  null  so  null  comma  description

649
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
null  comma  avatar  null  comma  language

650
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
tag  en  comma  now  this  is

651
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
how  you

652
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
update  any  of  your  parameters  by

653
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
the  way  so  now  we  have

654
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
our  p  open  i  think  that's

655
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,000
why

656
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
toggled  on  and  you  can  see

657
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
here  we  have  null  null  null

658
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
so  this  is  the  username  right

659
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
the  name  of  the  group

660
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
the  description  of  the  group  and

661
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
the  whether  or  not  it's  open

662
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
or  not  so  you  can  actually

663
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,000
really  play

664
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
around  here  and  update  any  of

665
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
these  values  so  now  if  we

666
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
hit  play  in  theory  it  should

667
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
just  work  so  we'll

668
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
come  in  here  submit  we  do

669
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
that  and  then  we  take  a

670
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
look  at  our  group  here  we

671
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
refresh  you'll  see  that

672
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
open  is  now  on  if  we

673
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
set  it  to  off  and  we

674
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
refresh  you'll  see  that  it  is

675
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
now  closed  so  that's  how  you

676
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,000
can

677
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
open  and  close  and  that's  really

678
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
how  you  can  update  any  of

679
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
these  values  so  if  i  came

680
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
in  here  if  i  come

681
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
back  to  godot  here  and  i

682
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
grab  my  description  i  believe  that's

683
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
name  description  avatar  url  so  if

684
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
i  name  this  the

685
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
strong  gamers  and  then  i  change

686
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
the  description  to  we  are  the

687
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
strong  gamers  exclamation  point

688
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
if  i  come  in  here  and

689
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
i  hit  this  little  toggle  here

690
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
well  our  session  got  dc'd  so

691
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
let  me  refresh  this  guy  real

692
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
quick  let  me  re -log  in

693
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
and  then  i'll  change

694
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
it  so  now  it's  going  to

695
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
be  open  and  the  titles  and

696
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
everything  has  been  changed  strong  gamers

697
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
we  are  the

698
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
strong  gamers  so  that's  how  you

699
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
can  update  those  values  now  again

700
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
typically  you  wouldn't  use  a  toggle

701
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
switch  to  do  this  i'm  just

702
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
showing  you  guys  how  to  do

703
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
that  so  i  can  show  you

704
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
the  open  and  close

705
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
really  quickly  you  can  see  now

706
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
it's  closed  so  that's  how  you

707
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
can  update  that  group  visibility  that's

708
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
how  you  can  update  the  group

709
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
values  information  values  for  your  group

710
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
now  something  else  that's

711
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
pretty  big  and  pretty  important  to

712
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
know  is  how  to  actually  list

713
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
groups  so  nakama  uh  groups  are

714
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
a  resource  like  anything  else  right

715
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
so  you  can  actually  list  them

716
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
and  index  them  and  pull  back

717
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
information

718
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
using  them  so  what  does  that

719
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
mean  well  that  means  that  you

720
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
can  use  what's  called  list  groups

721
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
asynchronously  to  actually  list  out  your

722
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
groups  so  if  i  come  in

723
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
here  i  can  show  you  guys

724
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
how  that  works

725
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
so  i'm  going  to  right  click

726
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
add  in  a  panel  like  so

727
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
i'll  drag  this  guy  over  here

728
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
like  this

729
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
and  i  will  make  an  h

730
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
box  container  or  i  guess  it'd

731
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
be  a  v  box  container  like

732
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
so  and  i'll  make  that  full

733
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
rect  so  that  way  it  maximizes

734
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
the  full  screen  now  granted  that

735
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
being  said  we  only  have  one

736
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,000
group  right

737
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
now  so  we  kind  of  need

738
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
to  make  multiple  groups  for  us

739
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
to  be  able  to  see  them

740
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
all  but  we  can  at  least

741
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
show  how  that  works  so  if

742
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
we  come  in  here  i  grab

743
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
this  add  user  to  group  button

744
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
i  duplicate  it  bring

745
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
it  down  here  and  i  type

746
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
list  groups  like  so  and  then

747
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
i'm  going  to  grab  this  description

748
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
duplicate  it

749
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
pull  it  down  here  and  this

750
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
is  going  to  be  group  query

751
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
like  so  i'll  change  this  to

752
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
list  groups

753
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
and  i'll  change  this  to  group

754
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
query  now  what  we  can  do

755
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
is  hit  ctrl  s  we  can

756
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
go  into  scripting

757
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
we  can  grab  our  list  group

758
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
go  to  node  right  click  disconnect

759
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
right  click  connect  and  connect  it

760
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
now  what  we  could  do  when

761
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
we  want  to  list  our  groups

762
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
is  we  can  set  up  a

763
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
limit  so  we  can  say  var

764
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
limit  is  equal  to  let's  say

765
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
10  now  we  don't  have  10

766
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
groups  to  list  but  we'll  use

767
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
that  as  a  default

768
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
value  then  we'll  say  var  result

769
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
is  equal  to  await  client  dot

770
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
list  groups  async  now  you'll  need

771
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,000
to

772
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
pass  in  your  session  just  like

773
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
usual  and  then  you'll  need  to

774
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
pass  in  some  kind  of  name

775
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
that  you're  trying  to

776
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
search  up  now  this  is  a

777
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
variant  so  of  course  you  can

778
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
you  know  get  back  whatever  you're

779
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
looking  for

780
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
so  in  my  case  i'm  going

781
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
to  hit  dollar  sign  group  query

782
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
dot  text  and  that'll  let  me

783
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
have  that  limit

784
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
and  then  we'll  pass  in  our

785
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
limit  which  by  the  way  does

786
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
default  to  10  now  they  have

787
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
a  cursor  value  and

788
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
that  cursor  value  allows  you  to

789
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
say  i  want  the  next  10

790
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
so  think  of  it  kind  of

791
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
like  this  when  you

792
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
do  your  query  you're  going  to

793
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
pull  back  the  first  10  but

794
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
what  happens  if  the  person  doesn't

795
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
see  the

796
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
group  that  they  want  on  the

797
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
first  10  well  that's  where  the

798
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
cursor  value  comes  in  so  you

799
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
can  hit  zero

800
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
make  that  cursor  value  of  zero

801
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
language  tag  will  allow  you  to

802
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
pick  a  language  in  my  case

803
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
i'm  going  to  do  en

804
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
and  again  you  don't  have  to

805
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
do  that  but  it's  going  to

806
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
filter  out  any  groups  that  are

807
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
not  english  you  can  see

808
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
right  here  language  en  so  that's

809
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
going  to  allow  you  to  have

810
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
that  limiting  factor  right  because  if

811
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
they're

812
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
spanish  you  don't  want  to  necessarily

813
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
show  them  up  if  they're  looking

814
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
for  an  english  group  if  they

815
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
speak  english

816
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
not  spanish  it's  going  to  be

817
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
a  problem  and  then  you  can

818
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
look  up  members  which  allows  you

819
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
to  pick  members  i'm  going  to

820
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
pass  in  null  for  that  and

821
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
then  you  could  choose  whether  or

822
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
not  it's  an  open  group  or

823
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
not  so  a  lot

824
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
of  times  when  you're  doing  groups

825
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
you  might  want  to  check  to

826
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
see  if  it's  a  public  group

827
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
not  a  private

828
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
group  because  sometimes  if  you  have

829
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
a  group  like  a  guild  and

830
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
you  don't  want  people  to  see

831
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
your  guild

832
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
you  probably  should  make  sure  that

833
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
that  is  false  or  true  depending

834
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
on  your  use  case  so  i'll

835
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
make  it  true

836
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
and  that's  pretty  much  everything  that

837
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
you  need  to  know  here  now

838
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
with  this  we  should  be  relatively

839
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
good  to  go  so  now  we

840
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
basically  will  have  our  results  we

841
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
can  say  for  group  in  result

842
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
dot  groups

843
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
like  that  and  then  we  can

844
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
basically  come  in  and  print  out

845
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
our  groups  so  you  can  see

846
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
that  we  can  go  print

847
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
group  dot  name  like  that  and

848
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
from  here  we  should  be  relatively

849
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
good  to  go  so  now  we

850
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
can  hit  play

851
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
we  can  log  in  as  test

852
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
we  can  come  in  here  and

853
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
say  i  believe  our  group  name

854
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
is  strong  gamers  so  we  can

855
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
say  strong  and  list  groups  and

856
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
it  should  come  back  well  it's

857
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
not  happy  so  that's  not  a

858
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
good  thing

859
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
our  p  cursor  query  parameters  strong

860
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
that's  fine  nakama  serialize  escape

861
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
cannot  convert  argument  one  from  int

862
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,000
to  string

863
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
i  wonder  if  it's  mad  because

864
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
our  cursor  is  an  int  i

865
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
think  there's  an  issue  here  with

866
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
how  they  have  their

867
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
stuff  set  up  so  what  if

868
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
we  come  back  here  and  we

869
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
do  null  instead  so  if  we

870
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
come  in  here

871
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
null  just  to  see  if  that

872
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
fixes  the  problem  so  we'll  come

873
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
in  here  we'll  type  strong

874
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
and  it's  still  mad  oh  that's

875
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
because  i  didn't  log  in  so

876
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
that's  fair  that's  understandable  so  we'll

877
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
log  in  we

878
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
we'll  say  strong  list  groups  and

879
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,000
you  can  see  that  we  get

880
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
a  400  the  error  name  filter

881
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,000
cannot  be  combined

882
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
with  any  other  filter  so  it

883
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
looks  like  according  to  nakama's  documentation

884
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
you  can  combine  them  but  i

885
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
guess  you  can't  inside  of  here

886
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
so  let's  try  that  and  see

887
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
if  that  fixes  it  because  according

888
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,000
to  our

889
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
documentation  you  can  do  this  but

890
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
i  guess  we  can't  so  let's

891
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
try  that

892
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
so  we'll  hit  list  groups  and

893
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
you  will  see  that  we  get

894
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
an  authorization  bearing  right  here  i

895
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
don't  know

896
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
if  that  came  back  with  really

897
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
anything  so  let  me  see  what

898
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
happens  if  i  list  groups  let's

899
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
see  what  our

900
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
result  comes  back  with  after  i

901
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
drop  a  breakpoint  here  and  it

902
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
did  it  came  back  with  nothing

903
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
so  nakama

904
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
is  not  doing  what  i  want

905
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
it  to  do  because  of  course

906
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
it's  not  welcome  to  programming  let's

907
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
see  what  happens

908
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
if  i  do  capital  s  it's

909
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
probably  capital

910
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
case  sensitive  so  we'll  come  in

911
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
here  and  we'll  take  a  look

912
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
at  our  results  still  got  nothing

913
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
back  so

914
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
we'll  continue  through  what  happens  if

915
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
i  do  a  percent  sign  and

916
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
see  if  that  gives  us  something

917
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
back  now  because  it  might  be

918
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
that  it  needs  to  be  a

919
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
query  of  some  description  so  we

920
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
can  check  that  out

921
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
real  quick  yep  it  needs  to

922
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
be  a  query  so  you  can

923
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
see  it  pulled  back  the  one

924
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
that  we're  looking  for  so

925
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
it  pulled  back  our  group  so

926
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
when  you  do  a  text  just

927
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
be  aware  of  that  you're  going

928
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
to  need  to  make  it

929
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
into  an  actual  query  instead  so

930
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
you  need  to  add  that  percent

931
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
sign  at  the  end  so  that's

932
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,000
just  something

933
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
to  keep  in  mind  now  you'll

934
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
see  when  i  hit  play  it's

935
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
going  to  print  out  strong  gamers

936
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
right  there

937
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
so  that's  basically  how  you  can

938
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
list  and  filter  your  groups  so

939
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
that  allows  us  to  see  those

940
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,000
groups

941
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
and  hunt  down  their  identifier  because

942
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
if  you  look  you  can  see

943
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
when  i  list  the  groups  you

944
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
can  see  when

945
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
i  come  in  here  and  i

946
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
take  a  look  at  my  results

947
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
here  the  group  i  come  back

948
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
with  has  their  identifier  right

949
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
here  so  if  you  know  where

950
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
their  um  if  you  know  their

951
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
name  you  can  pull  back  their

952
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
id  so  that's  how  we

953
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
would  populate  all  these  other  values

954
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
right  here  is  by  listing  it

955
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
and  then  pulling  back  that  group

956
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
information  now  since  we  can  pull

957
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
this  information  that  means  that  we

958
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
can  actually  come  in  here  and

959
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
use  that  info  on  our  panels

960
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
and  things  like  that  so  what

961
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
we  could  do  is  we  could

962
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
come  in  here  and  list  out

963
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
and  populate  their  information  and  populate

964
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
it  in  a  vbox  container  so

965
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
we  could  do  is  we  could

966
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
go  var  vbox  is  equal  to

967
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
vbox  container  dot  new  like  that

968
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
and  then  if  i  need  if

969
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,000
i  do  this  correctly

970
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
we  could  do  this  if  i

971
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
need  to  go  to  the  vbox

972
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,000
container  so  we  could  do  this

973
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
for  the  vbox  container  dot  new

974
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
and  then  we  could  come  in

975
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
here  and  do  the  same  thing

976
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
but  for  labels  so  we  can

977
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
say  label  so  var  name  label

978
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
is  equal  to  a  label  dot

979
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
new  like  that  and  then  name

980
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
label  dot  text  is  equal  to

981
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
if  we  take  a  look  at

982
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
this  right

983
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
here  we  can  go  name  so

984
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
it  would  be  group  dot  let's

985
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
take  a  look  at  this

986
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
what  is  result  dot  groups  let's

987
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
see  results  dot  groups  so  it's

988
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
going  to  come  back  with  this

989
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,000
so  then

990
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
it  would  be  dot  name  like

991
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
that  and  then  we  could  say

992
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
vbox

993
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
dot  add  child  and  then  we

994
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
could  add  our  name  label  as

995
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
a  part  of  that  child  and

996
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
then  we  can  come

997
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
in  here  and  say  dollar  sign

998
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
v  box  and  we  can  find

999
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
out  which  panel  is  ours  which

1000
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
arguably  we  should

1001
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
come  up  with  a  better  naming

1002
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
convention  here  but  that's  fine  dot

1003
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
add  child  and  we  could  add

1004
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
in  our

1005
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
vbox  right  here  like  that  and

1006
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
that  would  allow  us  to  effectively

1007
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
add  it  as  a  child  for

1008
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
our  project  and

1009
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
then  if  we  refresh  this  in

1010
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
theory  providing  that  this  is  going

1011
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
to  work  and  i  don't  know

1012
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,000
if  it's  going

1013
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
to  work  this  is  kind  of

1014
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
me  coding  this  a  little  bit

1015
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
off  the  cuff  we  can  hit

1016
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
list  groups  and  you  can

1017
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
see  that  we  now  have  strong

1018
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
gamers  there  so  that's  something  that

1019
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
we  can  actually  do  and  pull

1020
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,000
back

1021
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
their  information  so  that  could  be

1022
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
really  useful  for  us  to  set

1023
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
up  for  like  a  selection  system

1024
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,000
or

1025
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
something  like  that  and  speaking  of

1026
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
that  what  we  could  do  is

1027
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
we  could  come  in  here  and

1028
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
say  var  hbox

1029
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
is  equal  to  hbox  container  dot

1030
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
new  like  so  and  then  we

1031
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
can  do  hbox  dot  let's  see

1032
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
if  we  bring  this  down

1033
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
here  instead  of  doing  vbox  dot

1034
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
add  we  can  do  hbox  and

1035
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
then  we  could  add  our  vbox

1036
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
dot  add  child  hbox  dot  add

1037
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
child  hbox  like  so  and  then

1038
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
what  that  means  is  that  we

1039
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
could  add  in  a

1040
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
button  and  i  know  this  is

1041
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
kind  of  weird  because  i'm  actually

1042
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
coding  a  component  instead  of  doing

1043
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
it  the  other  way  but  one

1044
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
of  the  big  things  that  people

1045
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
have  asked  me  is  if  you

1046
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
could  actually  do  it

1047
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
this  way  and  i  want  to

1048
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
cover  that  and  show  you  guys

1049
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
yeah  you  can  actually  build  interface

1050
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
elements

1051
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
inside  of  code  and  then  actually

1052
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
have  it  exist  so  that's  kind

1053
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
of  what  i'm  showing  here  so

1054
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
if  we  come

1055
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
in  here  and  say  h  var

1056
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
button  is  equal  to  button  dot

1057
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
new  like  so  then  we  can

1058
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
come  in  here  and  do  button

1059
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,000
dot  text  is  equal  to  select

1060
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
group  like  that  and  then  we

1061
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
can  come  in  here  and  say

1062
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
h

1063
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
box  dot  add  child  button  like

1064
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
that  and  then  we  can  add

1065
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
that  h  box  and  that  should

1066
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
allow  us  to  have

1067
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
all  of  that  information  that  we

1068
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
were  looking  for  before  right  here

1069
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
so  if  we  hit  submit  list

1070
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
groups  you

1071
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
can  see  we  have  a  button

1072
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
right  here  so  now  we  can

1073
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,000
basically  connect  its  on  button  click

1074
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
right  here  so  you

1075
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
can  see  if  we  can  see

1076
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:09,000
button  dot  button  down  like  that

1077
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
dot  dot  connect  and  then  we

1078
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
could  just  say  and  here

1079
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
we  could  call  out  a  function

1080
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
so  if  i  come  in  here

1081
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
and  say  funk  on  group  select

1082
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
button  down  and  i  can  pass

1083
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
in  the  group

1084
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
like  that  and  i  can  do

1085
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
dot  connect  and  we  can  do

1086
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
what's  called  binding  and  binding  is

1087
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
actually  really  cool  so  we  can

1088
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
say  on  group  select  button  like

1089
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
that  dot  bind  and  then  i

1090
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
can  bind  parameters  so  i  can

1091
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
actually  come  in  here  and  bind

1092
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
group  and  now  if  we  come

1093
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
in  here  and  we  print  out

1094
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
that  group

1095
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
you'll  see  providing  that  we  did

1096
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
this  correctly  and  i  know  that

1097
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
this  is  like  way  beyond  what

1098
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,000
the  actual

1099
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
tutorial  is  but  i  think  that

1100
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
this  is  pretty  cool  so  i

1101
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
figured  i  would  show  it  off

1102
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
if  we  do  this  we  can

1103
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
come  in  here  and  list  our

1104
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
groups  and  then  select  a  group

1105
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
and  you'll  see  that  it  passes

1106
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
in  that  information

1107
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
right  there  it  binds  the  parameters

1108
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
so  you  could  actually  come  in

1109
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,000
here

1110
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
and  set  a  selected  group  parameter

1111
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
right  here  and  set  a  selected

1112
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,000
group  parameter  right  here  and  there

1113
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
you  go  it  would  actually  work

1114
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
so  what  we  could  do  is

1115
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
we  could  come  in  here  and

1116
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
say  all  the  way  up  here

1117
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
set  our

1118
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
var  selected  group  and  then  we

1119
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
could  come  down  here  and  just

1120
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
say

1121
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
selected  group  is  equal  to  group

1122
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
like  that  and  then  we  could

1123
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
come  in  here

1124
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
and  do  i  believe  it's  group

1125
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
dot  id  so  you  could  come

1126
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
in  here  and  go

1127
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
selected  group  dot  id  like  that

1128
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
copy  this  bad  boy  go  like

1129
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
this  paste  and  paste  and  paste

1130
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
and  then  you  would

1131
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
be  able  to  effectively  update  the

1132
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
values  in  there  without  needing  to

1133
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
actually  have  that  data  so  if

1134
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
i  come  in  here  i  list

1135
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
my  groups  well  first  i  need

1136
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
to  actually  hook  up  my  session

1137
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
really  quick  so  if  i

1138
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
submit  that  there  we  go  i

1139
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
list  my  groups  i  select  it

1140
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
now  i  have  that  selected  i

1141
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
can  come  in  here  and  do

1142
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
a

1143
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
open  and  you  will  see  that

1144
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
if  i  come  in  here  and

1145
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
i  refresh  this  you'll  see  that

1146
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
that  worked  and  that's

1147
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
that's  because  we  bound  that  parameter

1148
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
right  here  well  if  i  could

1149
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
find  it  right  here  to  actually

1150
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
work  so  that's  a  way  that

1151
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
we  can  go  about  making  a

1152
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
group  selection  system  relatively  simple  and

1153
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,000
that's

1154
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
how  we  can  actually  list  our

1155
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
groups  as  well  so  i  know

1156
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
that  that's  kind  of  a  complicated

1157
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
way  to  show  it  but  i

1158
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
figured  that  it  was  an  interesting

1159
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
way  to  approach  it  and  i

1160
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
figured  you  guys  would  appreciate  that

1161
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
so  now  the  question  is  what

1162
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
if  we

1163
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
want  to  promote  a  user  or

1164
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
maybe  demote  a  user  or  kick

1165
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
or  ban  a  user  from  our

1166
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
group  well  in  order  to  do

1167
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
that  first  we  need  to  actually

1168
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
get  the  user  id  of  that

1169
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
person  so  you  can  see  here

1170
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
this  person  is  a

1171
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
member  and  we  want  to  get

1172
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
that  user  id  back  so  if

1173
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
we  come  back  to  godot  here

1174
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
and  we  go  ahead  and  come

1175
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
down  here  we  need  to  basically

1176
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
get  a  username  go  and  fetch

1177
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
their  id  and  then  basically  promote

1178
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,000
or

1179
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
demote  that  person  so  what  i'm

1180
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
gonna  do  is  i'm  gonna  right

1181
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
click  my  panel  i'm  gonna  add

1182
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
in  a  line  edit

1183
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
like  so  i'm  gonna  drag  this

1184
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
guy  down  here  we'll  go  like

1185
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
this  make  it  about  i  don't

1186
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
know  about  that  big

1187
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
we'll  come  in  here  we'll  say

1188
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
user  user  to  manage  we'll  say

1189
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
and  then  we'll  come  in  here

1190
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
and  hopefully

1191
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
we  won't  run  out  of  space

1192
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
if  we  do  we'll  figure  something

1193
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
out  but  let's  right  click  add

1194
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
in  a  child

1195
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
node  let's  add  in  a  button

1196
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
we'll  add  in  a  button  for

1197
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
promoting  right  here  like  so  and

1198
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
if  i

1199
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
think  about  it  for  a  second

1200
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
with  groups  we  need  to  promote

1201
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
demote  kick  and  ban  somebody  and

1202
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,000
then  also

1203
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
leave  that  group  so  we'll  need

1204
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
to  figure  out  a  way  to

1205
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
give  ourselves  a  little  bit  more

1206
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
space  here

1207
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
because  i'm  running  out  so  maybe

1208
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
i  can  drag  this  guy  up

1209
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
butt  it  up  a  little  bit

1210
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
closer  drag  this  guy

1211
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
down  give  ourselves  a  little  bit

1212
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
more  space  but  we  can  promote

1213
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
duplicate  kick

1214
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
demote

1215
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
and  then  i  believe  we  would

1216
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
need  to  ban  somebody

1217
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
and  then  finally  the  last  interaction

1218
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
that  we  need  to  do  is

1219
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
to  actually  come  in  here  and

1220
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
leave  so  we  could  just  come

1221
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
over  ah  goodness  we're  running  out

1222
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
of  space  here  we  have  so

1223
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,000
much

1224
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
functionality  here  it's  actually  hard  to

1225
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
make  the  space  so  we'll  drag

1226
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
this  guy  down  a  tiny  bit

1227
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,000
maybe

1228
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
give  ourselves  a  bit  more  space

1229
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
over  here  drag  this  guy  over

1230
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
like  so  there  we  go  and

1231
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
we  can  change  this

1232
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
one  to  leave  group  like  that

1233
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
now  when  we  want  to  promote

1234
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
a  user  let's  change  the  name

1235
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
of  this  to  promote  user

1236
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
kick  user  demote  user  and  ban

1237
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
user  like  that  and  then  leave

1238
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
free  so  i'm  going  to  go

1239
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
ahead  and  grab  promote  user  and

1240
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
i'm  going  to  change  my  line

1241
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
edit  to  user  to

1242
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
manage  and  then  i'll  click  on

1243
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
promote  user  we're  going  to  go

1244
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
ahead  and  connect  that  to  our

1245
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
nakama

1246
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
controller  here  we'll  come  down  here

1247
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
and  we'll  basically  go  ahead  and

1248
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
promote  a  user  so  first

1249
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
things  first  we  need  to  actually

1250
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
get  our  user  account  now  unfortunately

1251
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
you  need  to  actually  go  and

1252
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,000
fetch

1253
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
that  user  account  so  first  we'll

1254
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
say  var  user  is  is  type

1255
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
nakama  api  dot  api

1256
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
users  is  equal  to  await  client

1257
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
dot  get  users  async  and  then

1258
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
we  can  come  in  here  and

1259
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
go  session  so  we

1260
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
could  pass  in  that  session  and

1261
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
then  we  need  to  pass  in

1262
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
ids  so  when  you  do  this

1263
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
you  can  pass  in  ids  or

1264
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
usernames  in  our  case  we're  going

1265
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
to  pass  in  a  username  but

1266
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
you  can  pass  in  their  actual

1267
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
um  id  as  well

1268
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,000
so  i'm  just  going  to  pass

1269
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
in  a  blank  and  then  for

1270
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
the  username  i'll  just  pass  in

1271
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
a  single  parameter

1272
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
and  that's  going  to  be  dollar

1273
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
sign  user  to  manage  dot  text

1274
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
comma  and  you'll  see  that  they

1275
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
also  have

1276
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
a  facebook  id  in  this  case

1277
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
we'll  pass  in  null  we  don't

1278
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
really  have  a  facebook  id  to

1279
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
manage  a  user

1280
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
but  they  do  separate  that  out

1281
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
and  i'm  not  really  sure  why

1282
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
they  do  that  but  that's  a

1283
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
thing  so  it's  just

1284
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
something  to  keep  in  mind  now

1285
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
what  we  can  do  is  say

1286
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
for  you  in  users  dot  users

1287
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
and  that's  a  really

1288
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
bad  way  so  we'll  say  result

1289
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
and  then  we'll  just  do  result

1290
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
dot  users  that's  going  to  be

1291
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,000
a  little  bit

1292
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
better  than  what  we're  doing  right

1293
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
now  now  once  we  do  this

1294
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
we  have  the  actual  user  information

1295
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
so

1296
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
that's  how  you  pull  back  that

1297
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
user's  information  so  you  can  actually

1298
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
just  do  you  dot  id  and

1299
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,000
that  will

1300
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
be  their  identification  right  that'll  be

1301
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
their  actual  information  so  what  we

1302
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
can  do  is  we  can  come

1303
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
in  here  and  promote  that  user

1304
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
so  we'll  come  in  here  and

1305
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
say  await  client  dot  promote  user

1306
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
and  group  async

1307
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
you  can  pass  in  our  session

1308
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
token  and  then  we  can  pass

1309
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
in  our  group  id  so  in

1310
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
our  case  that's  going  to  be

1311
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
our  selected  group  dot  id  comma

1312
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
and  i  believe  it's  selected  group

1313
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
dot  id  let  me  double  check

1314
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
really  quick  because  sometimes  i  forget

1315
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
things  it  is  and  then  we

1316
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
have  to  pass  in  a  user

1317
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:23,000
identifier

1318
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
so  that's  going  to  be  u

1319
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
dot  id  like  that  and  now

1320
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
if  we  go  ahead  and  hit

1321
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
play  you'll  see  in  a  second

1322
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
that  if  i  connect  to  this

1323
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
and  then  i  list  my  groups

1324
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
i  select  my  group  and  then

1325
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
i  type  in

1326
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
test  two  and  i  click  promote

1327
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
well  we  have  an  error  so

1328
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
the  error  is  cannot  convert  argument

1329
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,000
three  from

1330
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
string  to  a  packed  array  and

1331
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
that's  because  this  can  be  a

1332
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
group  of  users  it's  not  actually

1333
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
just  one

1334
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
group  it's  actually  multiple  people  so

1335
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
we  can  go  ahead  and  do

1336
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
that  and  then  try  it  again

1337
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
so  it's

1338
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
because  we  need  we  can  actually

1339
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
have  multiples  of  somebody  so  we'll

1340
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
go  like  that  we'll  submit  we'll

1341
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
list  our  groups  select  group  test

1342
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
two  we'll  promote  that  person  you'll

1343
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
see  that  that  looks  like  that

1344
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
was  successful  we'll  head  back  to

1345
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
our  nakama  console  we'll  refresh  and

1346
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
you  will  see  that  this  person

1347
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
is  now

1348
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
an  admin  so  that's  huge  because

1349
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
it's  going  to  allow  us  to

1350
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
be  able  to  create  admins  and

1351
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
now  if  we  click  it  a

1352
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
second  time  you'll  see  if  we

1353
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
refresh  they  are  now  a  super

1354
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
admin  that  means  that  they  can

1355
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
delete  this

1356
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
group  if  they  want  to  now

1357
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
the  question  might  be  okay  so

1358
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
i  can  promote  users  how  do

1359
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
i  demote  them

1360
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
right  well  if  we  come  in

1361
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
here  we  go  in  right  here

1362
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
we  go  into  demote  user  button

1363
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
down  let's  connect  that

1364
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
real  quick  we  come  in  here

1365
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
and  basically  copy  and  paste  this

1366
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
code  so  we'll  just  copy  this

1367
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:56,000
guy

1368
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
paste  it  and  instead  of  promote

1369
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
we  can  just  pass  in  demote

1370
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
easy  enough  and  same  thing  for

1371
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
kick  user

1372
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
right  we  could  just  kind  of

1373
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
bring  that  in  and  let's  do

1374
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
band  user  as  well  right  so

1375
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
we'll  just  bring  that

1376
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
in  as  well  if  we  copy

1377
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
this  guy  we  can  copy  paste

1378
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
and  paste  because  they're  all  the

1379
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
exact  same  functionality

1380
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
so  we  can  come  in  here

1381
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
and  say  kick  group  users  and

1382
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
then  ban  group  users

1383
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
and  now  if  i  refresh  this

1384
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
you'll  see  if  i  submit  list

1385
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
groups  select  my  group  test  two

1386
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
i  go  demote

1387
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
you'll  see  that  that  worked  if

1388
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
we  come  over  here  we  refresh

1389
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
our  users  right  here  you'll  see

1390
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,000
that  they  are

1391
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
now  an  admin  and  then  i

1392
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
can  go  ahead  and  ban  a

1393
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
user  and  you'll  see  non -existent

1394
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
function  ban  groups

1395
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
that's  probably  my  fault  group  users

1396
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
async  and  it  looks  like  you

1397
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
actually  can't  ban  a  user  so

1398
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
we'll

1399
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
remove  that  that's  my  fault  i

1400
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
um  was  reading  the  documentation  earlier

1401
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
but  it  looks  like  it  got

1402
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
removed  so  you're  not  actually  able

1403
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
to  ban  a  user  anymore  from

1404
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
a  group  so  we'll  come  in

1405
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
here  we'll

1406
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
go  ahead  and  type  submit  list

1407
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
our  groups  select  our  group  we'll

1408
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
go  to  test  two  we'll  go

1409
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
ahead  and  demote

1410
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
the  user  so  you'll  see  if

1411
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
we  refresh  they  are  an  admin

1412
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
if  we  come  in  here  we

1413
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
can  go  ahead  and  kick  them

1414
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
and  then  if  we  refresh  you

1415
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
will  see  they  have  been  removed

1416
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
from  that  group  and  that's  basically

1417
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
how  you

1418
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
can  actually  manage  your  users  in

1419
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
here  and  you  can  also  delete

1420
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
a  group  and  leave  a  group

1421
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
so  if  we  want

1422
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
to  leave  a  group  we  can

1423
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
come  in  here  and  go  into

1424
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
our  stuff  here  we  can  click

1425
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
on  leave  group  button  down

1426
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
on  leave  button  down  we'll  connect

1427
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
that  and  to  leave  a  group

1428
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
it's  actually  relatively  simple

1429
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
all  we  need  to  do  is

1430
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,000
type

1431
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
await  client  dot  leave  group  async

1432
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
we'll  pass  in  our  session  and

1433
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
then  we'll  pass  in  our  group

1434
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:16,000
id  which

1435
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
is  going  to  be  our  selected

1436
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
group  id  now  this  will  allow

1437
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
us  to  leave  our  group  but

1438
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:23,000
the  problem  is  that

1439
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
if  i  leave  my  group  i

1440
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
will  actually  um  not  have  any

1441
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
more  users  in  that  group  so

1442
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
what  i'll  do  is  i'll

1443
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
log  in  as  test  two  i

1444
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
will  come  in  here  and  pass

1445
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
in  my  group  name  if  i

1446
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
remember  correctly  it's  if  we

1447
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
list  groups  we  can  select  the

1448
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
group  join  group  and  then  you

1449
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
should  see  that  we  will  join

1450
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
that  group  so

1451
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
you'll  see  as  a  member  we

1452
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
can  refresh  and  there  we  go

1453
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
we're  in  that  group  and  now

1454
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
we  can  come  in  here

1455
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
and  say  leave  group  and  then

1456
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
if  we  refresh  we  have  left

1457
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
that  group  right  there  and  now

1458
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
we  can  actually

1459
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
uh  safely  delete  our  group  right

1460
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
because  we  now  have  shown  that

1461
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
that  section  works  that's  how  you

1462
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
leave  a  group  it's  actually  really

1463
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
easy  you  just  do  leave  group

1464
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
asynchronously  so  now  what  happens  if

1465
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
you  want  to  delete  a  group

1466
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
well  we're  going  to  need  an

1467
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
additional  button  for  that  so  let's

1468
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
duplicate

1469
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
our  leave  group  we'll  just  pull

1470
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
it  down  here  i  guess  we're

1471
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
kind  of  running  out  of  space

1472
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:24,000
here  so  i'll  just

1473
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
put  it  right  here  i'll  move

1474
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
open  over  we'll  grab  leave  group

1475
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
and  we'll  put  delete  group  now

1476
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
in  order

1477
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
to  delete  a  group  we'll  disconnect

1478
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
this  connect  in  order  to  delete

1479
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
a  group  it's  actually  really  simple

1480
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
as  well  so  when  you  delete

1481
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
a  group  all  you  need  to

1482
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
do  is  type  client  await  client

1483
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
dot  delete  group  async

1484
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
and  then  you  can  pass  in

1485
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
the  session  and  the  selected  group

1486
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
dot  id  and  that's  literally  all

1487
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
you  need  to  do  so  now

1488
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
if  i  refresh  my  screen  here

1489
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
i  log  in  as  test  the

1490
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
super  admin  and  then

1491
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
we'll  log  in  as  test  we'll

1492
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:08,000
come  in  here  we'll  log  in

1493
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
as  test  2  we'll  submit  we

1494
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
will  go  ahead  and  hit

1495
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
list  groups  we'll  select  that  group

1496
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
we're  going  to  join  that  group

1497
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
really  quick  and  remember  because

1498
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
this  is  an  open  group  that

1499
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
person  should  be  able  to  just

1500
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
join

1501
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
there  we  go  so  the  person

1502
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
has  joined  and  now  you'll  see

1503
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
if  i  go  in  as  test

1504
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
2  right  here  and  i  go

1505
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:34,000
ahead

1506
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
and  i  click  delete  group  which

1507
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
this  is  leave  group  but  it's

1508
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
delete  group  in  um  our  code

1509
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
you'll  see

1510
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
request  has  returned  spot  response  400

1511
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
group  not  found  or  you  are

1512
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
not  allowed  to  delete  and  the

1513
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
reason  why  is  because  that  person

1514
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
does  not  have  the  capability  to

1515
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
delete  this  group  you  can  see

1516
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:52,000
it's

1517
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
still  here  however  if  i  come

1518
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
in  here  as  test  or  as

1519
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
my  super  admin  and  i  log

1520
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
in  and  i  click  list  groups

1521
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
i

1522
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
select  my  group  and  then  i

1523
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
click  delete  group  you'll  see  if

1524
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
we  go  back  to  groups  it

1525
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
has  now  been  removed

1526
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
and  that's  basically  everything  that  you

1527
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
need  to  know  about  groups

1528
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
now  when  it  comes  to  chats

1529
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
which  is  actually  a  whole  feature

1530
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
inside  of  nakama  you  can  actually

1531
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:21,000
build  chat

1532
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
rooms  right  inside  of  nakama  so

1533
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
when  it  comes  to  chats  how

1534
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
do  we  actually  get  that  to

1535
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
work  well  first

1536
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
things  first  we  are  majorly  out

1537
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
of  space  so  i  am  going

1538
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
to  hide  the  group  section  as

1539
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,000
you  can  see  we

1540
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
have  all  sorts  of  different  areas

1541
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
here  where  we  can  actually  do

1542
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
our  nakama  work  here  so  i'm

1543
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
actually  just

1544
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
going  to  come  in  here  and

1545
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
just  start  hiding  a  lot  of

1546
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
this  because  we're  running  out  of

1547
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
space  here

1548
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
so  i'll  hide  this  panel  and

1549
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
this  panel  and  there  we  go

1550
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
so  when  it  comes  to  chats

1551
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
we  have  three  different

1552
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
types  of  chats  and  we'll  talk

1553
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
about  all  three  of  them  and

1554
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
how  to  send  messages  and  stuff

1555
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
like  that

1556
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
but  we  have  three  different  chat

1557
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
types  we  have  dynamic  rooms  group

1558
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
chats  and  direct  chats  okay  and

1559
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
we'll

1560
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
talk  about  the  group  chats  when

1561
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
we  get  there  but  one  of

1562
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
the  big  ones  that  a  lot

1563
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
of  people  like  is  the

1564
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
dynamic  rooms  the  dynamic  rooms  is

1565
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
basically  a  random  room  that  gets

1566
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
created  for  temporary

1567
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
for  a  temporary  time  span  and

1568
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
it  only  stays  open  as  long

1569
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
as  there  are  people  in  that

1570
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
chat  room  so  the

1571
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
nice  thing  about  it  is  let's

1572
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
say  you  have  a  match  or

1573
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
something  like  that  you  could  put

1574
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:39,000
people  in  that

1575
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
temporary  room  and  then  have  people

1576
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
communicate  and  then  once  the  match

1577
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
is  over  that  room  just  gets

1578
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
dissolved  over  time  whereas  something  like

1579
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
a  group  chat  that  stays  for

1580
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
as  long  as  the  group  exists

1581
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
and  then  they  also  have  direct

1582
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
chats  which  is  basically  one -on

1583
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
-one  communications  between  people

1584
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
which  persist  once  again  forever  so

1585
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
in  order  to  do  dynamic  rooms

1586
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
let's  first  right  click  add  in

1587
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:05,000
a  child

1588
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
node  let's  add  in  a  panel

1589
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
here  and  let's  make  it  about

1590
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
this  big  now  we're  gonna  have

1591
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
to  build  a  whole

1592
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
chat  system  so  this  will  take

1593
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
a  little  bit  of  time  so

1594
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
what  i'm  gonna  do  is  i'm

1595
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
gonna  right  click  add

1596
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
a  child  node  i'm  gonna  add

1597
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
in  a  button  i'm  going  to

1598
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
right  click  add  a  child  node

1599
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
add  in  a  line  edit  right

1600
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
here  we're  going  to  make  the

1601
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
line  edit  about  yay  big  give

1602
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
or  take  if  my  mouse  will

1603
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
let  me  we'll  do  that  we'll

1604
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:38,000
add  in  a  button

1605
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
again  providing  that  i  can  click

1606
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
on  this  there  we  go  we'll

1607
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
make  it  about  yay  big  and

1608
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
for  our  line  edit  we'll  just

1609
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:46,000
say

1610
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
chat  name  like  that  and  then

1611
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
we'll  come  in  here  and  say

1612
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,000
join  chat  now  you  could  automate

1613
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
this  as  soon  as  a  person

1614
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
goes  into  a

1615
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
match  you  could  actually  go  set

1616
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
up  the  uh  room  name  and

1617
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
automatically  have  them  join  but  in

1618
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
this  case  we're  gonna  manually  do

1619
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
it  that  way  you  guys  get

1620
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
the  experience  of  how  to  make

1621
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:08,000
this  look  at  it  all  so

1622
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:08,000
you  can  turn  on  the  greenbar

1623
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
it  works  so  what  we'll  do

1624
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
is  we'll  change  this  to  join

1625
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
chat  room  like  that  and  then

1626
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
the  line  at  it

1627
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
will  be  chat  name  like  that

1628
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
and  then  i'm  going  to  come

1629
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
in  here  go  over  here  button

1630
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
down  and  then  i

1631
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
will  hit  connect  now  when  we

1632
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
want  to  join  a  chat  room

1633
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
all  we  have  to  do  is

1634
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
come  up  with  a  room  name

1635
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
if  it's  persistent  if  it's  hidden

1636
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
and  if  it  is  a  room

1637
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
type  so  i  will  show  you

1638
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:39,000
all  of  those  things

1639
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
so  first  things  first  let's  go

1640
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
var  channel  is  equal  to  await

1641
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
socket  dot  join  chat  asynchronously

1642
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
now  what  this  is  going  to

1643
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:52,000
do  is  we're  going  to  have

1644
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
a  target  now  that  target  is

1645
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
what  the  name  of

1646
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
that  chat  room  is  going  to

1647
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
be  in  this  case  we'll  just

1648
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
say  actually  we  already  have  a

1649
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
title  right  here

1650
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,000
right  so  dollar  sign  chat  name

1651
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
dot  text  comma  and  then  you'll

1652
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
see  that  we  have  an  int

1653
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
type  so  what

1654
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
does  that  actually  take  what  is

1655
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
the  type  well  the  type  is

1656
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
a  nakaba  socket  chat  type  or

1657
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
a  channel  type

1658
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
so  we'll  say  var  type  is

1659
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,000
equal  to  nakaba  socket  dot  channel

1660
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
type  dot  and  you'll  see  that

1661
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
we  have

1662
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
different  types  direct  direct  message  group

1663
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
and  room  and  each  one  has

1664
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
a  different  use  so  thankfully  the

1665
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
code  is  basically  the  same  but

1666
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
what  matters  is  if  it  is

1667
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
going  to  be  a  room  if

1668
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
it's  going  to  be

1669
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
a  group  or  if  it's  going

1670
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
to  be  a  direct  message  in

1671
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
our  case  it's  going  to  be

1672
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
a  room  so  i'm  going  to

1673
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
come  in  here  and  say  type

1674
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
comma  and  then  if  it's  persistent

1675
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
so  in  our  case  we  don't

1676
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
want  it  to  be

1677
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
persistent  so  false  comma  and  then

1678
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
if  it's  hidden  it  will  say

1679
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:05,000
false  we  want  it  to  make

1680
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
it  a  public

1681
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
messaging  chat  so  people  can  actually

1682
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
go  in  and  message  each  other

1683
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
and  not  have  to  authenticate  or

1684
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
be  added  to  that  chat  and

1685
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:15,000
then  what  i'm  going  to  do

1686
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
is  i'm  going  to  print  that

1687
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
chat  information  so  print

1688
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
channel  like  that  now  this  will

1689
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
basically  print  out  our  chats  information

1690
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
so  if  i  refresh  this  and

1691
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:27,000
i

1692
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
run  this  if  i  join  and

1693
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
i  say  test  and  i  join

1694
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
you'll  see  that  we  now  have

1695
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
a  chat  that  is  right  here

1696
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:35,000
you

1697
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
can  see  it  has  the  id

1698
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
one  it  has  id  here  it

1699
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
says  there's  a  user  test  user

1700
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
id  is  this  session  id  is

1701
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:43,000
this

1702
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
so  we  can  get  all  the

1703
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
people  that  are  inside  of  that

1704
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
chat  right  there  now  if  somebody

1705
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
else  joins

1706
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
test  to  submit  and  then  they

1707
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
go  test  and  they  join  you

1708
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
can  see  here  that  we  also

1709
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
joined  channel  id  to

1710
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
user  presence  session  this  status  user

1711
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
test  so  we  just  got  back

1712
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
that  user's  account  information  right

1713
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
so  we  got  test  and  test

1714
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
to  in  this  chat  with  each

1715
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
other  and  that's  basically  what  these

1716
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:12,000
guys  are

1717
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
saying  here  now  in  order  to

1718
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
send  a  message  you  need  to

1719
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
actually  be  able  to  receive  that

1720
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
message  right

1721
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
so  let's  go  to  our  script

1722
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
here  and  let's  scroll  all  the

1723
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
way  up  to  the  top  and

1724
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:25,000
the  reason  why  i'm

1725
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
scrolling  all  the  way  up  to

1726
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
the  top  is  because  we  need

1727
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
to  subscribe  when  we  create  our

1728
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
socket  to

1729
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
the  ability  to  actually  get  messages

1730
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
so  what  we  need  to  do

1731
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
is  go  find  where  our  socket

1732
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
gets  created

1733
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
which  is  right  here  so  we'll

1734
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
come  in  here  we'll  say  socket

1735
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
dot  and  providing  that

1736
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
godot  wants  to  be  nice  to

1737
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
me  it  will  auto  complete  please

1738
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,000
maybe  not  well  we'll  hit  dot

1739
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
received  underscore

1740
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,000
channel  underscore  message  dot  connect  like

1741
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
that  and  then  we'll  pass  in

1742
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
a  callable  so  what  this  is

1743
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
going  to  be  is  it's  just

1744
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
going  to  be  a  very  basic

1745
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
function  that  prints  out  that  message

1746
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:16,000
currently  at

1747
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
least  so  we'll  say  funk  underscore

1748
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:26,000
on  underscore  channel  on  channel

1749
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
message  like  that  and  we'll  pass

1750
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
in  a  message  now  this  could

1751
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
be  a  type  if  you  want

1752
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
it  to  be  which  is

1753
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
going  to  be  a  nakama  api

1754
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:46,000
dot  api  channel  message  like  that

1755
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
and  then  we  can  just  go

1756
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
ahead  and  print  that

1757
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:53,000
message  and  there  we  go  now

1758
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
we're  going  to  connect  that  message

1759
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
so  we'll  just  pass  on  channel

1760
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:57,000
message

1761
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
like  that  and  that  will  actually

1762
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
pass  that  to  this  guy  right

1763
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
here  and  we'll  go  ahead  and

1764
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:03,000
send  out  that

1765
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
signal  now  when  we  do  our

1766
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,000
message  when  we  want  to  send

1767
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
a  message  we  need  to  actually

1768
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
create  a  panel  for

1769
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
that  so  let's  come  in  here

1770
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
let's  right  click  our  panel  and

1771
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
add  in  a  another  panel  like

1772
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
so  i'm  going

1773
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
to  drag  this  guy  over  here

1774
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
make  it  about  this  big  give

1775
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
or  take  it  we're  going  to

1776
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
create  a  very  basic

1777
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
message  block  system  so  it's  going

1778
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
to  be  pretty  ugly  my  apologies

1779
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
but  i  want  to  try  to

1780
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
get  this  to

1781
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
work  as  quickly  as  humanly  possible

1782
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
so  what  i'm  going  to  do

1783
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
is  i'm  going  to  put  in

1784
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
a  line  edit  like  so

1785
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
i'm  going  to  make  this  go

1786
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
on  the  bottom  stretched  across  i'm

1787
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
going  to  pull  this  back  right

1788
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,000
click

1789
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
add  a  child  node  we'll  add

1790
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
in  a  button  i'm  going  to

1791
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
snap  that  guy  right  in  the

1792
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
bottom  right  where

1793
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
we'll  make  it  about  if  i

1794
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
can  click  on  it  about  yay

1795
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
big  we'll  put  a  send  or

1796
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
maybe  just  like  an  arrow

1797
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
like  that  i  think  that'll  work

1798
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
we'll  put  a  placeholder

1799
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
chat  text  here  we'll  type  this

1800
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
as  chat  text  we'll  make  the

1801
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
panel  title  chat  and  then  we'll

1802
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
make  the

1803
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
button  submit

1804
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
chat  like  that  i'm  going  to

1805
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
go  ahead  and  right  click  add

1806
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
any  child  node  and  i'm  going

1807
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
to  add  in  a

1808
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
i  am  brain  farting  on  what

1809
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
it  is  it  is  a  text

1810
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
edit  like  that  we'll  make  it

1811
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
full  screen  so  full

1812
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
rect  and  we'll  make  it  about

1813
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
yay  big  that'll  go  ahead  and

1814
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
make  it  so  that  it's  kind

1815
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
of  scalable  and

1816
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
you  know  easy  to  use  now

1817
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
inside  of  here  i'll  scroll  down

1818
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
and  i  will  do  auto  wrap

1819
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
that's  fine  so  that  means

1820
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
that  if  i  put  in  a

1821
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
bunch  of  text  here  it's  going

1822
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
to  auto  wrap  so  you  can

1823
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
see  if  i  do  wrap  mode

1824
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:56,000
boundary

1825
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
it  will  go  ahead  and  wrap

1826
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
that  and  then  i  will  turn

1827
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
on  scroll  as  well  so  if

1828
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
this  continues  so  we'll

1829
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
ctrl  c  ctrl  v  we'll  paste

1830
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
it  you'll  see  that  it's  going

1831
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
to  scroll  we  also  want  to

1832
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
we'll  want  to  shut

1833
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
off  editable  and  i  think  that

1834
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
will  work  because  i  think  this

1835
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
is  placeholder  text  so  if  i

1836
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:17,000
come  in  here

1837
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
and  we  paste  this  text  in

1838
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
this  will  allow  us  to  scroll

1839
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
i'm  curious  if  we  can  make

1840
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
it  follow

1841
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
the  uh  actual  scrolling  but  i

1842
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
don't  think  we  can  i  know

1843
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
there's  a  way  to  do  it

1844
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
it's  been  a  while  since

1845
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
i've  done  it  but  i  think

1846
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
i'll  just  go  ahead  and  skip

1847
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,000
that  part  but  there  is  a

1848
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
way  to  make  it  so  it

1849
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
automatically  scrolls  to  the  bottom  but

1850
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
that's  okay  right  now  so  this

1851
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
is  basically  what  our  chat  setup

1852
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:45,000
is

1853
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
going  to  be  it's  going  to

1854
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
be  relatively  simple  but  it's  going

1855
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
to  be  something  that  we  can

1856
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:49,000
at  least

1857
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
use  now  i'm  going  to  grab

1858
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
my  submit  chat  button  i'm  going

1859
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
to  go  to  node  button  down

1860
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
i'm  going  to  connect

1861
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
that  to  my  submit  chat  button

1862
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,000
now  when  we  want  to  do

1863
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
a  message  right  we  want  to

1864
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
send  a  message  we  can  come

1865
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,000
in  here  and  say  var  await

1866
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,000
socket  dot  write  chat  message  asynchronous

1867
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
now  this  is  going  to  require

1868
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
a  id  so  we  have  to

1869
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
actually  have  some  kind  of  chat

1870
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
name  in  this  case  i'm  just

1871
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
going  to  go  ahead  and  grab

1872
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
this  guy  right  here  copy  it

1873
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
and  paste  it  it's  not  the

1874
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
most  ideal  situation  because  once  you're

1875
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
connected

1876
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
to  that  channel  you  should  probably

1877
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
just  be  connected  to  that  channel

1878
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,000
right  instead  of

1879
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
passing  in  this  value  here  but

1880
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
we  can  basically  throw  a  value

1881
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
up  at  the  top  and  basically

1882
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
just

1883
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
save  it  across  different  functions  and

1884
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
that  would  solve  this  problem  but

1885
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
for  right  now  we'll  go  ahead

1886
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
and  do  this  and  then  we

1887
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
need  to  pass  in  our  message

1888
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
content  so  what  we  can  do

1889
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
is  do  dollar  sign

1890
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:59,000
chat  text  dot  text  like  that

1891
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
now  i  think  we  should  probably

1892
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
change  this  to  text  edit  instead

1893
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:03,000
just  do

1894
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
chat  text  box  that  way  we

1895
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
actually  have  that  value  now  if

1896
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
we  hit  play  and  we  go

1897
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
ahead  and  hit  play

1898
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
if  we  come  in  here  we

1899
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,000
both  submit  join  test  test  number

1900
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
two  submit  join  test  if  we

1901
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
send  a  text

1902
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
test  test  test  you'll  see  that

1903
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
it  is  very  mad  at  us

1904
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
cannot  convert  argument  to  from  string

1905
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:31,000
to  dictionary

1906
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
so  it's  going  to  require  a

1907
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
dictionary  for  us  to  be  able

1908
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
to  do  that  so  what  we

1909
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
need  to  do  is  we  need

1910
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
to  pass  in  an  actual  dictionary

1911
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
of  objects  so  we  can  come

1912
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
in  here  pass  in  this  dictionary

1913
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
like  so  and  go  quote  message

1914
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
colon  that  and  the  reason  why

1915
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
we  have  to  do  this  is

1916
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
because  we  can  actually

1917
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:02,000
do  what's  called  emotes  right  and

1918
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
emotes  are  sent  via  um  json

1919
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
data  so  that's  the  reason  why

1920
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
it  requires  it  to

1921
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
be  a  dictionary  so  that  we

1922
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
can  actually  send  over  emote  information

1923
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
now  i'm  not  going  to  cover

1924
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:14,000
that

1925
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
just  because  uh  there's  a  whole

1926
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
like  loading  emotes  and  stuff  like

1927
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
that  that  you  need  to  do

1928
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:20,000
and  that's

1929
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
way  beyond  the  basics  of  this

1930
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
tutorial  so  if  you  guys  want

1931
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
to  look  at  that  you  guys

1932
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:25,000
can  go  check  out

1933
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
their  real -time  chatting  section  and

1934
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
they'll  go  over  that  but  i'll

1935
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
go  ahead  and  hit  submit  test

1936
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
to  submit

1937
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
join  test  join  test  test  send

1938
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
and  you'll  see  that  we  actually

1939
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
get  an  error  so  it  says

1940
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
invalid  chat

1941
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
identifier  so  what's  going  on  here

1942
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
right  well  if  you  take  a

1943
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,000
look  at  your  chat  here  if

1944
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
we  take  a  look  at

1945
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
our  chat  you'll  see  that  our

1946
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
chat  actually  has  an  identifier  id2

1947
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,000
you  see  that  so  when  you

1948
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:01,000
have

1949
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
a  chat  it  actually  has  an

1950
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
identifier  associated  with  that  chat  and

1951
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
so  you  don't  want  to  pass

1952
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:09,000
in

1953
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
the  title  of  the  chat  you

1954
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
want  to  pass  in  the  identifier

1955
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
you  can  see  that  we  have

1956
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
a  channel  right  here

1957
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
so  if  i  go  channel .id

1958
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
we  can  go  ahead  and  refresh

1959
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,000
this  guy  and  go  submit  test

1960
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
submit  and  you'll  see  that

1961
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
we  are  now  printing  out  and

1962
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
you  will  see  that  we  have

1963
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
an  id  right  here  i  added

1964
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
channel  id  in  post  so

1965
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
that  way  it  was  nice  and

1966
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
quick  but  you  can  see  right

1967
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
here  channel  id  is  two  dot

1968
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
dot  dot  test  so  two  is

1969
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
the

1970
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
id  of  the  chat  and  test

1971
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
is  the  actual  id  that  we

1972
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
gave  it  so  we  need  to

1973
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
pass  that  value  in  right  here

1974
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:48,000
for

1975
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
us  to  be  able  to  send

1976
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
messages  so  what  we  can  do

1977
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
is  we  can  come  in  here

1978
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
copy  this  var  channel  go  all

1979
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
the

1980
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
way  up  to  the  top  and

1981
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:04,000
go  var  current  channel  like  that

1982
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
and  then  we  go  all  the

1983
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
way  back  down  to  the

1984
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:11,000
bottom  and  do  current  channel  is

1985
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
equal  to  that  and  then  we'll

1986
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
go  ahead  and  copy  this  we'll

1987
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
paste  it  right

1988
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
here  dot  id  and  then  we

1989
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
can  go  ahead  and  do  current

1990
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
channel  dot  id  right  here  as

1991
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
well  now  what  that

1992
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
will  do  is  that  it  should

1993
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
allow  us  to  actually  send  it

1994
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
to  the  proper  id  so  we'll

1995
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
hit  submit  test  to

1996
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,000
submit  test  join  test  join  test

1997
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
send  and  you  should  see  right

1998
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
here  we  no  longer  have  an

1999
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
error  but  instead

2000
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,000
we  have  an  actual  message  right

2001
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
here  i  probably  should  not  have

2002
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
used  the  word  test  i  should

2003
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
probably  use  this  is  a  test

2004
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
message  that  way  we  can  actually

2005
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
see  what  it  is  and  you

2006
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
can  see  here  that

2007
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
i  send  a  message  and  you

2008
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
see  right  here  channel  id  test

2009
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
code  is  zero  content  message  this

2010
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,000
is  a  test

2011
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
message  and  that's  basically  how  we

2012
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
can  send  and  receive  messages  now

2013
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
the  nice  thing  is  that  if

2014
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
since  we

2015
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:13,000
typed  our  message  section  and  unfortunately

2016
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
this  is  getting  pretty  large  so

2017
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
i  might  want  to  abstract

2018
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
some  of  this  out  but  if

2019
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
we  go  to  right  here  where

2020
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
our  on  channel  message  is  at

2021
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
we  have  our  different

2022
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
messages  that  we  can  message  information

2023
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
here  that  we  can  actually  use

2024
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
so  if  we  type  message  dot

2025
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:33,000
you'll  see

2026
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
that's  going  to  automatically  give  us

2027
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
some  information  here  that  we  can

2028
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
work  with  so  you  can  see

2029
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
that  we

2030
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
have  sender  id  username  all  sorts

2031
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
of  information  so  the  nice  thing

2032
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
is  i  can  come  in  here

2033
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
and  i  can  go

2034
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
dollar  sign  chat  text

2035
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,000
box  dot  text  plus  equals  message

2036
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
dot  user  name

2037
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:08,000
plus  colon  space  plus  message  dot

2038
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
and  then  if  we  take  a

2039
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
look  there  should  be  a

2040
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
content  dot  message  like  that

2041
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
like  that  and  we  should  probably

2042
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
also  go  ahead  and  pass  in

2043
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
a  new  line  because  we  want

2044
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
the  user  to

2045
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
have  a  new  line  here  now

2046
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:38,000
so  let's  try  this  var  content

2047
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
is  equal  to  message  dot  content

2048
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:45,000
and  then  i  wonder  if  content

2049
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
dot  message  will  work  instead

2050
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
okay  there  we  go  we'll  try

2051
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
that  and  see  if  that  works

2052
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
also  i'm  going  to  want  to

2053
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
put  a  new  line  at  the

2054
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:55,000
end  of  this

2055
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
so  we'll  go  ahead  and  do

2056
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
that  slash  n  for  a  new

2057
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
line  that  way  every  time  somebody

2058
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
sends  a  message  it's  going  to

2059
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
be  a  new  lined  message

2060
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
and  now  if  i  refresh  this

2061
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
in  theory  this  should  work  so

2062
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
we'll  go  ahead  and  do  submit

2063
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
test  join

2064
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,000
test  to  submit  test  join  test

2065
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,000
send  and  it  is  very  unhappy

2066
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
so  let's  take  a  look  you

2067
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
can  see  the  content  here  is

2068
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
a

2069
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
string  data  so  it  looks  like

2070
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
we're  going  to  need  to  json

2071
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
parse  this  information  so  go  json

2072
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
dot  parse  string

2073
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
and  we'll  go  ahead  and  pass

2074
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:32,000
that  in

2075
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
and  there  we  go  and  that

2076
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
should  fix  that  problem

2077
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
basically  content  is  a  json  value

2078
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
so  that's  something  that  i  didn't

2079
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
think  about  i'm  talking  without

2080
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
thinking  as  i'm  doing  this  tutorial

2081
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
so  forgive  me  but  we  need

2082
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
to  actually  parse  that  data  so

2083
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
now  if  we  hit

2084
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
send  you'll  see  test  test  test

2085
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
this  is  a  test  message  like

2086
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
so  test  to  this  is  a

2087
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:58,000
test  message

2088
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
and  that's  basically  how  you  could

2089
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
do  a  very  basic  communication  system

2090
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
so  now  the  question  is  okay

2091
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
great  that's  fine  but  how  do

2092
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,000
i  actually  do  group  chats  and

2093
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
in  order  to  do

2094
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
group  chats  what  we  need  to

2095
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
do  is  we  need  to  come

2096
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
in  here  and  we  need  to

2097
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
go  ahead  and  grab  another

2098
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
joint  chat  here  and  what  i'm

2099
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
going  to  do  is  i'm  going

2100
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
to  unhide  my  group  section  and

2101
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
i  guess  i'll

2102
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
just  move  it  over  so  we

2103
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
have  a  little  bit  more  space

2104
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
let's  grab  this  guy  we'll  drag

2105
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
him  over  like

2106
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,000
this  it's  getting  a  little  on

2107
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
the  cramped  side  with  our  uh

2108
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
setup  here  so  i  might  need

2109
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
to  readjust  some

2110
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
stuff  but  i  don't  think  i

2111
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
can  fit  it  really  up  here

2112
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
so  we'll  just  kind  of  push

2113
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
it  over  here  and  that

2114
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
should  just  work  i  mean  it's

2115
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
a  little  tight  but  it  will

2116
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
work  for  the  demonstration  we're  trying

2117
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:53,000
to  do

2118
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
here  so  if  i  grab  this

2119
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
guy  here  i  right  click  disconnect

2120
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
inspector  change  this  to  join  group

2121
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
chat

2122
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
like  so  when  you  want  to

2123
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
do  a  group  chat  all  you

2124
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
got  to  do  is  come  in

2125
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,000
and  basically

2126
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
i  move  this  guy  over  there

2127
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
we  go  all  you  really  need

2128
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
to  do  is  you  need  to

2129
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:15,000
come  in  here

2130
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
connect  your  button  down  so  go

2131
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
ahead  and  connect  that  over  here

2132
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
and  then  we  can  come  in

2133
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:21,000
here  and

2134
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
basically  just  grab  this  exact  code

2135
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
right  here  it's  almost  a  duplication

2136
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
right  it's  almost  exactly  the

2137
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
same  we'll  just  drop  that  guy

2138
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,000
in  there  and  all  we  really

2139
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
need  to  do  is  come  in

2140
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
here  and  when  we  do

2141
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
our  join  socket  asynchronously  we  just

2142
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
basically  need  to  pass  in  our

2143
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
group  id  so  we'll  say  and

2144
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:44,000
i

2145
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
believe  we  have  a  group  if

2146
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
i  remember  correctly  so  selected  group

2147
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
.id  and  then  we  can  pass

2148
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:52,000
in  type

2149
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
for  persistence  we're  going  to  want

2150
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
to  say  true  because  we  want

2151
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
to  keep  that  group  around  right

2152
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
and  then  we  want  it  to

2153
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
be  persistent  and  we  also  want

2154
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
to  change  this  to  a  type

2155
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
group  chat  and  then

2156
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
what  we  can  do  is  we

2157
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
can  come  in  here  hit  play

2158
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:14,000
come  over  here  submit  test  we

2159
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
will  go  ahead  and  create  a

2160
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
group  so  that  way  now  our

2161
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
group  actually  exists  so  if  we

2162
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
refresh  our  groups  i'll  have  to

2163
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
re -log  in

2164
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
because  this  is  another  recording  session

2165
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
and  you  can  see  we  now

2166
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
have  a  test  group  and  we

2167
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
are  now  a

2168
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
part  of  it  now  from  here

2169
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
we  can  join  that  group  with

2170
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
test  two  so  we'll  come  in

2171
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
here  and  i  already  did

2172
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
this  one  so  we'll  do  test

2173
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:40,000
two  test  join  group  and  it

2174
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
got  mad  at  me  because  our

2175
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
selected  group  is  not

2176
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
correct  and  that's  my  fault  so

2177
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
that's  totally  fine  so  i  will

2178
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
have  to  refresh  real  quick  so

2179
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
we'll  say

2180
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
submit  test  we  will  go  ahead

2181
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
and  list  our  groups  we'll  select

2182
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
our  test  group  we'll  do  test

2183
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:57,000
to

2184
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
list  our  groups  select  it  join

2185
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
that  group  and  then  when  we

2186
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
join  our  chat  we  can  just

2187
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
join  group  chat

2188
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
growing  group  chat  and  then  test

2189
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
and  you  will  see  that  this

2190
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
guy  now  gets  it  and  if

2191
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
we  go  this  is  a  test

2192
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
message  and  we  send  that  guy

2193
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
you  can  see  that  that  message

2194
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
gets  sent  now  you  might  be

2195
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
going  okay

2196
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
so  why  does  this  matter  right

2197
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
what  is  the  benefit  of  a

2198
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
group  chat  versus  a  dynamic  chat

2199
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
well  where  a

2200
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
group  chat  matters  and  why  it's

2201
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
important  is  because  you  can  do

2202
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,000
what's  called  listing  the  message  history

2203
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
so  because  it's  a  persistent  chat

2204
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:39,000
we're  going  to  be  able  to

2205
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
pull  back  all  of  that  information

2206
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
so  the  reason  why  that's  cool

2207
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
is  because  we  can  come  in

2208
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
here  and  we  can  say  okay

2209
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
when  the  user  joins  a

2210
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
group  which  we'll  have  to  scroll

2211
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
down  here  to  right  here  and

2212
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
we'll  need  to  go  ahead  and

2213
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
come  in  here

2214
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
and  list  out  that  information  so

2215
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
we'll  say  far  result  is  equal

2216
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:09,000
to  await  client  dot  list  channel

2217
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
messages  asynchronous  we'll  pass  in  our

2218
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
session  and  then  we'll  pass  in

2219
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
our  currently  selected  groups

2220
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
so  selected  group  dot  id  we

2221
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
could  pass  in  a  limit  value

2222
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
so  in  our  case  we'll  just

2223
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
do  100  that's  a  very

2224
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,000
decent  value  forward  basically  forward  is

2225
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
forward  or  backwards  right  so  we

2226
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
can  grab  the  oldest  or  the

2227
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
newest  and  that's  what  forward  is

2228
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
as  forward  is  the  newest  so

2229
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
we'll  say  forward  so  we'll  say

2230
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
true  comma

2231
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
and  then  i  believe  they  have

2232
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
a  cursor  value  as  well  and

2233
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
cursor  is  if  i  remember  correctly

2234
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
it's  defaulted

2235
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
let's  double  check  really  quick  if

2236
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
we  hit  comma  cursor  variance  is

2237
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
null  so  cursor  allows  you  to

2238
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
say  i

2239
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
want  you  to  start  at  this

2240
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
point  so  if  you're  picking  up

2241
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
the  next  100  values  let's  say

2242
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
you  have  500  messages

2243
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
you  can  pass  in  number  200

2244
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
and  then  it'll  grab  from  200

2245
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
to  300  if  that  makes  sense

2246
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
so  in  our  case  i'll

2247
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
just  leave  that  as  null  because

2248
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,000
it's  just  going  to  be  easier

2249
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
for  us  to  work  with  it

2250
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
now  we  can  go  for

2251
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,000
our  message  in  result  dot  message

2252
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:23,000
like  that  messages  like  that  and

2253
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
then  we  can  basically  just  go

2254
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
exactly

2255
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
what  we  did  before  so  we

2256
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
can  come  up  here  and  grab

2257
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
if  you  remember  how  we  actually

2258
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
parsed  out  our  data

2259
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
which  arguably  i  should  move  this

2260
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
down  closer  to  my  actual  message

2261
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
functionality  so  let's  go  ahead  and

2262
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
just  do  that  really  quick  we'll

2263
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
come  down  here  and  just  drop

2264
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
it  right  let's  see  this  is

2265
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:49,000
group  stuff

2266
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
this  is  chat  stuff  so  we'll

2267
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
go  ahead  and  just  drop  it

2268
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
right  there  and  that'll  just  kind

2269
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
of  keep  it  within

2270
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
the  group  area  so  that  way

2271
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
i  can  basically  come  in  here

2272
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
and  do  this  and  say  chat

2273
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,000
room  code  right  here  and

2274
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
that'll  give  me  somewhere  to  actually

2275
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
look  at  this  now  what  we

2276
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
could  do  is  we  could  basically

2277
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:10,000
just  grab

2278
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:15,000
this  copy  it  and  paste  and

2279
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
that's  all  we  need  to  do

2280
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
and  then  in  theory  this  should

2281
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
just  work  so  now  if

2282
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,000
we  hit  play  in  theory  if

2283
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
we're  lucky  it  will  work  so

2284
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
we'll  go  here  we'll  say  list

2285
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
groups  select  group

2286
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
join  group  chat  and  we  got

2287
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,000
an  error  message  return  response  invalid

2288
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,000
channel  id  so  we  have  a

2289
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
failure  here

2290
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
that  says  that  our  channel  id

2291
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:44,000
is  incorrect  so  let's  see  join

2292
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:49,000
chat  asynchronously  list  channel  messages  that

2293
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:54,000
should  be  correct  is  it  printing

2294
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
out  what  i  expect  let's  see

2295
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
so  i  don't  think  that  this

2296
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
worked  100  here  so

2297
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,000
let's  try  submitting  list  groups  select

2298
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
group  that  should  select  our  group

2299
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
and  then  i  should  be  able

2300
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
to  join  group  chat  but  it

2301
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
did  not  take  it  so  the

2302
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
question  is  is  it  because  i

2303
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
failed  to  join  the  group  chat

2304
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,000
or  did  it  fail  here  so

2305
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,000
if  we  do  this  the  id

2306
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
of  the  group

2307
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,000
id  is  string  get  return  if

2308
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,000
not  string  else  string  await  list

2309
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,000
channel  messages  try  refresh  and  it's

2310
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:35,000
going

2311
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
to  run  through  that  real  quick

2312
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
but  it  didn't  do  anything  as

2313
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:45,000
expected  so  if  i  drop  a

2314
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
breakpoint  here

2315
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,000
what  is  result  result  is  an

2316
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,000
object  id  cacheable  null  null  so

2317
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
we  got  a  nakama  exception  invalid

2318
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:56,000
channel  id

2319
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
so  the  question  is  is  did

2320
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
our  channel  get  saved  let's  go

2321
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
ahead  and  take  a  look  at

2322
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
nakama  really  quick

2323
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,000
chat  messages  group  chat  no  messages

2324
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
found  so  our  group  chat  just

2325
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
doesn't  exist  so  that's  not  great

2326
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:13,000
so

2327
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
that  means  something  went  wrong  with

2328
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
how  we  initialized  our  group  chat

2329
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
i  think  okay  so  i

2330
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
figured  out  the  issue  so  basically

2331
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,000
when  we  do  our  list  channel

2332
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
messages  async  we  need  to  actually

2333
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:25,000
do  our

2334
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
current  channel  dot  id  instead  so

2335
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
when  we  do  our  join  chat

2336
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
asynchronous  we  pull  back  a  channel

2337
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:32,000
and  that's

2338
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
the  channel  that  we're  currently  in

2339
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
and  basically  we  need  to  go

2340
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
and  list  those  message  right  here

2341
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
and

2342
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
then  i  have  a  section  here

2343
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
for  messages  in  result  messages  if

2344
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
the  message  content  does  not  contain

2345
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
an  empty  so  if  for  some

2346
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
reason  a  message  gets  in  there

2347
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,000
that's  empty  when  we  try  to

2348
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
parse  it  it's

2349
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
going  to  break  so  i  have

2350
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
this  little  if  statement  right  here

2351
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
that  basically  just  checks  to  see

2352
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
if  it's

2353
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
empty  if  it  is  ignore  it

2354
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
and  there's  no  reason  to  have

2355
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
it  so  now  if  i  hit

2356
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,000
play  you'll  notice  that  when  i

2357
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
come  in  here  and  i  hit

2358
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
submit  i  list  my  groups  i

2359
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
select  my  groups  and  i  join

2360
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
my  group  chat  you'll  see

2361
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
i  pull  back  those  messages  and

2362
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
that's  one  of  the  big  cool

2363
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
features  of  nakama  is  that  it

2364
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:17,000
keeps  track

2365
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
of  all  of  that  information  because

2366
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
this  is  after  we  removed  and

2367
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
rebooted  the  system  right  it  actually

2368
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
came  back  with  the  proper  messages

2369
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
that's  basically  what  persistence  does  right

2370
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,000
here  this  true  right

2371
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
here  causes  it  to  be  saved

2372
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,000
and  to  be  reusable  later  that's

2373
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
one  of  the  big  cool  advantages

2374
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:42,000
here

2375
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
so  now  the  question  is  okay

2376
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
so  how  do  i  do  peer

2377
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
-to -peer  messaging  well  it's  not

2378
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
technically  peer -to -peer

2379
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
but  how  do  i  send  messages

2380
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,000
directly  to  a  user  well  again

2381
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,000
it's  relatively  simple  if  we  come

2382
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
into  our

2383
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
stuff  here  we  control  c  control

2384
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,000
v  join  group  chat  and  then

2385
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
instead  of  join  group  chat  we

2386
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
have  a

2387
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,000
join  direct  chat  i  go  ahead

2388
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
and  grab  our  where  is  it

2389
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
join  group  chat  right  here  and

2390
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
i  change  this  to

2391
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
join  direct  chat  like  that  we

2392
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
can  come  in  here  disconnect  right

2393
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,000
click  connect  and  connect  now  in

2394
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
order  to  do  a  direct  chat

2395
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
it's  actually  relatively  easy  it's  exactly

2396
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
the  same  as  everything  else  you

2397
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,000
come  in  here  you  go  join

2398
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
chat  room  right  here  copy  it

2399
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
come  down  here  paste  well  really

2400
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:41,000
actually  we

2401
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
probably  should  just  grab  this  to

2402
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
be  honest  it's  going  to  save

2403
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
us  a  bit  of  trouble  so

2404
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
if  we  paste  this

2405
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
guy  in  here  change  the  channel

2406
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
type  to  direct  message  like  that

2407
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
instead  of  having  a  selected  group

2408
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:54,000
id

2409
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,000
we  need  to  grab  the  user

2410
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
id  in  terms  of  persistence  we

2411
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
want  to  keep  true  we  also

2412
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
want  to  keep  false  for

2413
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
hidden  but  for  this  join  chat

2414
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
asynchronous  we  can  go  ahead  and

2415
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,000
pass  in  a  user  id  so

2416
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
we  need  to  get  our

2417
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
actual  user  identifier  and  the  easiest

2418
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
way  to  do  that  is  by

2419
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
using  the  get  users  asynchronous  call

2420
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
if  you

2421
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
remember  we  did  that  earlier  so

2422
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,000
we'll  just  say  var  users  is

2423
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,000
equal  to  await  client  dot  get

2424
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
users  asynchronous

2425
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
and  then  we'll  pass  in  our

2426
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
session  and  we  need  to  pass

2427
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
in  a  id  pack  string  array

2428
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
and  then  the  user  name

2429
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
that  we're  going  to  be  passing

2430
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
in  so  in  our  case  i

2431
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
think  if  we  take  a  look

2432
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
at  our  user  interface  we

2433
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
have  a  chat  name  we  could

2434
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
probably  just  take  that  i  think

2435
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
that  will  work  so  for  the

2436
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
chat  name  what  i'll

2437
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
do  is  i'll  just  pull  this

2438
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
guy  which  is  chat  name  so

2439
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
we'll  come  into  our  script  we'll

2440
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
hit  dollar  sign  chat  name

2441
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
dot  text

2442
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
and  then  that  should  bring  back

2443
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
our  users  so  now  we  know

2444
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
that  it's  going  to  bring  back

2445
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
one  user  and

2446
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
that's  it  so  since  it's  going

2447
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
to  bring  back  one  user  we

2448
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:16,000
can  basically  just  do  if  users

2449
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
dot  size

2450
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,000
is  greater  than  zero  then  we

2451
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
can  do  the  rest  of  this

2452
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
bit  of  code  here  and  then

2453
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
we  can  just  pass  in  and

2454
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
say  users  bracket  bracket  zero  dot

2455
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
id  and  that'll  pass  back  a

2456
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,000
user  id  that  we  can  actually

2457
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:35,000
communicate

2458
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
with  so  now  in  theory  this

2459
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
should  work  and  of  course  as

2460
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
always  with  theory  it  doesn't  always

2461
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
work  but

2462
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
we'll  see  so  we'll  submit  as

2463
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
test  we'll  submit  as  test  two

2464
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
and  then  we'll  go  test  two

2465
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
join  direct  chat

2466
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
it's  mad  and  that's  because  users

2467
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,000
came  back  let's  see  with  an

2468
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
array  it  looks  like  it's  users

2469
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
dot  users

2470
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
so  that's  my  fault  so  we'll

2471
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,000
say  users  dot  users  and  i

2472
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
should  probably  just  do  this  as

2473
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
results  then

2474
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
or  perhaps  user  results  because  we

2475
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
don't  want  to  mess  with  our

2476
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
current  code  down  here  that  has

2477
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
results

2478
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
already  we'll  just  do  that  and

2479
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
then  for  this  we'll  just  say

2480
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,000
user  results  dot

2481
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
users  bracket  bracket  zero  because  we

2482
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
now  know  that  we  need  to

2483
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
go  a  little  bit  deeper  than

2484
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:31,000
what  we

2485
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
expected  so  now  if  we  go

2486
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:38,000
ahead  and  submit  test  two  join

2487
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
direct  chat  now  we're  in  a

2488
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
direct  chat  if  we  go

2489
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
into  test  two  and  we  go

2490
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
to  test  join  direct  chat  we

2491
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
pass  test  in

2492
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
okay  so  i  think  i  figured

2493
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
out  what's  going  on  here  so

2494
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
i  commented  this  out  just  so

2495
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
we  could  check  it  out

2496
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
but  what  i  think  is  going

2497
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,000
on  here  is  remember  in  our

2498
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:08,000
previous  tutorial  we  had  test  block

2499
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
test  two

2500
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
and  because  they're  blocked  they  can't

2501
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,000
send  them  messages  so  it  completely

2502
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
stops  them  from  being

2503
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
able  to  communicate  with  each  other

2504
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
and  that's  why  this  is  happening

2505
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,000
so  if  i  remove  this  let's

2506
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:23,000
see  what

2507
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
happens  if  i  do  that  so

2508
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
we'll  go  ahead  and  come  in

2509
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
here  we'll  control  s  we'll  hit

2510
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,000
play  and  then  we'll  try

2511
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
it  one  more  time  so  we'll

2512
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,000
do  submit  test  to  submit  test

2513
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,000
join  direct  chat  test  to  join

2514
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
direct  chat  test

2515
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
we  will  send  a  message  and

2516
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
that  will  now  work  now  the

2517
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
reason  why  this  didn't  work  was

2518
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
because  test  had

2519
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
test  two  blocks  so  since  they're

2520
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
blocked  they  can't  communicate  at  all

2521
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
so  that's  the  reason  why  this

2522
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:59,000
happened  so  it  was  my  fault

2523
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
but  that  was  basically  the  reasoning

2524
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
now  if  we  go  ahead  and

2525
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
stop  this

2526
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
and  then  we  come  in  here

2527
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
and  uncomment  this  with  control  k

2528
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,000
and  then  we  run  this  bad

2529
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
boy  in  theory  we

2530
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
should  be  able  to  see  our

2531
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,000
previous  communications  so  test  to  join

2532
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
direct  chat  and  you  will  see

2533
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,000
there's

2534
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000
all  of  our  messages  now  i'm

2535
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
getting  a  little  bit  additional  messages

2536
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,000
mostly  because  of  my  testing

2537
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
not  because  of  a  problem  with

2538
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
nakama  that's  just  something  that  i

2539
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
did  on  my  own  by  accident

2540
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
but  you

2541
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
can  see  here  are  all  of

2542
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
the  messages  that  we  have  so

2543
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,000
that's  basically  how  you  do

2544
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
messages  back  and  forth  inside  of

2545
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
nakama

2546
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
hey  guys  editor  mitch  here  so

2547
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,000
something  that  you  should  do  once

2548
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
you  do  your  chat  system  and

2549
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:55,000
you

2550
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
get  that  guy  settled  when  you

2551
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,000
have  this  chat  right  here  what

2552
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
you  should  also  do  is  subscribe

2553
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
to

2554
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
everybody's  channels  so  if  you  have

2555
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
friends  or  some  kind  of  channel

2556

01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:11,000

2558
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
channel  so  what  i'm  gonna  do

01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
i'm  gonna  go  ahead  and  come

2563
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
in  here  and  i'm  gonna  have

2564
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
sub  to

2565
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,000
friend  channels  like  that  now  i'm

2566
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
gonna  scroll  down  and  i  have

2567
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,000
a  chat  section  in  here  so

2568
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
you  can  see

2569
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
we  have  our  little  group  section

2570
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
right  here  we  scroll  down  we

2571
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
have  a  chat  room  code  right

2572
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:37,000
here  so  this  is

2573
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
our  chat  section  so  right  here

2574
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:43,000
just  somewhere  in  this  general  section

2575
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
here  we're  gonna  go  ahead  and

2576
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
add

2577
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
in  the  ability  to  sub  to

2578
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
the  friend  channels  right  so  we'll

2579
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:57,000
say  funk  sub  to  friends  channels

2580
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:57,000
like  that

2581
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
and  then  what  i'm  gonna  do

2582
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,000
is  say  var  results  is  equal

2583
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:08,000
to  await  client  dot  list  friends

2584
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:08,000
asynchronously

2585
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
i'm  gonna  pass  in  my  session

2586
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,000
and  that'll  just  bring  in  all

2587
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
of  my  friends  and  then  from

2588
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:13,000
here

2589
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
i  can  go  ahead  and  subscribe

2590
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
to  their  channel  so  for  i

2591
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,000
in  results  dot  friends

2592
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,000
like  that  and  then  i'm  gonna

2593
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
go  ahead  and  say  var  type

2594
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:29,000
is  equal  to  nakama  socket  dot

2595
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
channel  type  dot

2596
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
direct  message  and  then  i  can

2597
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
go  ahead  and  pull  back  my

2598
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,000
chat  that  i  have  so  i

2599
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,000
can  sub  to  that  channel

2600
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
so  i  can  say  await  socket

2601
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:45,000
oh  i  have  sub  to  friends

2602
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
sub  to  friend  so  we'll  do

2603
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
friend  channels  and  that'll  fix

2604
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
that  little  function  not  found  so

2605
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,000
socket  dot  join  chat  async  and

2606
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
then  i'll  go  ahead  and  pass

2607
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,000
an  i  dot

2608
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:01,000
user  dot  id  comma  type  comma

2609
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:05,000
true  comma  false  and  that'll  basically

2610
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
allow  me  to  pull  those  sockets

2611
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:07,000
back

2612
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
now  this  should  return  if  i

2613
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
remember  correctly  a  channel  so  if

2614
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
we  actually  hit  ctrl  f  you

2615
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:12,000
can  see  we

2616
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
have  a  couple  of  them  you

2617
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
can  see  we  have  current  channel

2618
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
right  here  so  what  i'm  going

2619
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
to  do  is  i'm

2620
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
going  to  come  in  here  and

2621
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:23,000
say  chat  channels  is  equal  to

2622
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
await  socket  okay  and  actually

2623
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
now  that  i  think  about  this

2624
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
let's  do  this  so  we'll  do

2625
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
channel  let's  do  this  channel  is

2626
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
equal  to  this  and  then  we

2627
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
can  come  down  here  and  just

2628
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
say

2629
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:46,000
chat  channels  bracket  bracket  bracket  bracket

2630
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:46,000
bracket  bracket  bracket  bracket  bracket  i

2631
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
dot  user  dot  id

2632
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,000
actually  i  wonder  if  i  should

2633
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,000
do  dot  user  name  instead  that

2634
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
way  it's  just  a  more  common

2635
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
value

2636
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
and  i  could  go  is  equal

2637
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:02,000
to  channel  like  that  and  that'll

2638
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
basically  hook  our  channel  here  to

2639
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:05,000
this  object

2640
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
so  i'll  say  var  and  then

2641
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,000
there  we  go  and  chat  channels

2642
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
doesn't  exist  yet  but  now  we

2643
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
have  a  key

2644
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
value  pair  here  that  we  can

2645
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
use  and  that's  going  to  be

2646
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
really  big  for  us  if  we

2647
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
want  to

2648
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
use  those  channels  later  so  now

2649
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
i  can  go  ahead  and  grab

2650
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
chat  channels  i  can  go  up

2651
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
to  the  top

2652
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,000
var  chat  channels  like  that  and

2653
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
i  can  actually  come  in  here

2654
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,000
and  now  i  have  access  to

2655
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
all  of  my  chats

2656
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
right  here  so  if  i  have

2657
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
like  100  chats  i  could  actually

2658
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
pull  back  the  channel  information  and

2659
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
switch  between  them  really  easily  using

2660
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,000
this  object  and  i'll  probably  go

2661
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
through  that  later  but  it's  a

2662
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
way  to  extend  our  chat  to

2663
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,000
be  a  bit  more  useful  if

2664
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
that  makes  sense  so  if  you

2665
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,000
think  about  it  like  this

2666
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
basically  what  we  could  do  is

2667
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
we  could  add  in  a  tab

2668
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:05,000
container  right  here  make  that  guy

2669
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000
full  screen

2670
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
and  then  underneath  that  tab  container

2671
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
you  can  actually  switch  between  different

2672
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:12,000
tabs  right

2673
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,000
and  i  think  what  we  could

2674
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:15,000
do

2675
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,000
and  again  this  is  going  to

2676
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
be  a  lot  of  coding  and

2677
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
then  we  could  actually  come  in

2678
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
here  make  this  about  i

2679
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
know  about  this  big  give  or

2680
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
take  and  then  we  could  put

2681
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
that  chat  text  underneath  here  right

2682
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
and  this

2683
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
would  allow  us  to  in  theory

2684
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,000
do  this  and  then  change  the

2685
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,000
title  of  this  to  username  like

2686
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,000
so  you  can  see

2687
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,000
here  here's  the  username  so  what

2688
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,000
we  could  do  at  least  in

2689
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,000
theory  is  on  startup  once  we

2690
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,000
subscribe  to

2691
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
all  of  those  all  of  those

2692
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
channels  it  would  just  fill  this

2693
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
out  so  for  instance  if  we

2694
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:55,000
come  in  here

2695
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
and  we  go  and  subscribe  to

2696
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
those  friend  channels  so  if  we

2697
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
grab  this  guy  bring  it  down

2698
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
here  come  in  here

2699
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:09,000
and  then  basically  just  say  tab

2700
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
container  or  i  guess  it's  going

2701
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:15,000
to  be  dollar  sign  tab  container

2702
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
dot

2703
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
add  child  and  then  we  could

2704
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
add  a  child  of  this  text

2705
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:27,000
box  here  so  basically  if  we

2706
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
add  a  child  of  this  text

2707
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
box  and  i'm  just  kind  of

2708
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,000
thinking  this  through  as  i  talk

2709
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,000
to  you  guys  so  my  apologies

2710
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
for  how  confusing

2711
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
this  is  probably  going  to  end

2712
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
up  being

2713
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,000
but  we  could  do  a  text

2714
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,000
box  so  this  is  going  to

2715
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:47,000
be  a  text  edit  so  var

2716
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:51,000
current  edit  is  equal  to  text

2717
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:51,000
edit

2718
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,000
dot  new  like  that  and  then

2719
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
we  could  pass  in  our  current

2720
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
edit  like  that  to  make  that

2721
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:05,000
a  object  and  then  we

2722
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:05,000
click  on  the  text  edit  is

2723
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
equal  to  our  user  name  right

2724
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,000
here  so  i  dot  user  dot

2725
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
user  name  like  so

2726
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:16,000
and  then  when  we  log  in

2727
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
you'll  see  that  i'm  going  to

2728
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,000
have  a  tab  right  here  called

2729
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
username  but  if  i  click

2730
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,000
on  login  and  it's  mad  at

2731
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
me  so  you  can  see  invalid

2732
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,000
index  test  2.  so  let's  take

2733
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
a  look  at  this  so  create

2734
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
chat  null  so  this  is  a

2735
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
null  object  it  needs  to  be

2736
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
a  type  dictionary  that's  my  guess

2737
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
at  least  so  we'll

2738
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,000
come  in  here  we'll  say  colon

2739
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
equals  bracket  bracket  like  that  and

2740
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
that'll  make  it  into  an  object

2741
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,000
and

2742
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
now  if  we  try  it  it

2743
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,000
should  in  theory  work  there  we

2744
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:47,000
go  and  you  can  see  we

2745
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
have  test  2  and  username

2746
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
right  here  and  that  means  that

2747
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
we  would  be  able  to  go

2748
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
and  fetch  any  messages  that  we

2749
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
want  from  that

2750
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
person  so  if  we  were  to

2751
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
go  in  here  sub  to  friend

2752
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
chat  go  down  here  we  could

2753
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
actually  go  and  fetch

2754
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
that  person's  information  if  you  remember

2755
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
we  actually  do  that  right  here

2756
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,000
we  pull  back  the

2757
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
messages  right  here  so  what  we

2758
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
could  do  is  if  we  list

2759
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:16,000
channel  messages  asynchronously  we  should

2760
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
probably  pull  this  out  and  just

2761
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
do

2762
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,000
list  messages  like  that  do  this

2763
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
it's  going  to  want  to  have

2764
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,000
a  current  channel  dot  id

2765
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:30,000
so  current  channel  like  that  and

2766
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,000
then  we  could  come  in  here

2767
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
and  just  do

2768
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:39,000
current  edit  dot  text  is  equal

2769
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,000
to  list  messages  and  then  we

2770
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,000
have  to  pass  in  our  current

2771
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
channel  so

2772
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,000
that  would  be  our  let's  see

2773
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
channel  right  here  so  channel  so

2774
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
we'll  pass  to  that  channel  that'll

2775
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:51,000
pass

2776
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
back  all  of  the  text  in

2777
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
that  channel  this  is  a  coroutine

2778
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
so  it  must  be  called  with

2779
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
await

2780
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
that  makes  sense  so  await

2781
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
and  then  instead  of  doing  this

2782
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,000
we'll  just  return  that  value  so

2783
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,000
we'll  just  say  var  text  oh

2784
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
i  guess

2785
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
i'm  gonna  have  to  create  a

2786
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
text  so  var  text  is  equal

2787
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
to  quote  and  then  we'll  need

2788
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
to  just  do  text  plus

2789
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
equals  blah  and  then  we  can

2790
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,000
just  return  our  text  like  that

2791
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
and  then  that  will  return  text

2792
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:28,000
right  here

2793
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,000
and  then  instead  of  doing  this

2794
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:34,000
when  we  join  a  chat  group

2795
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
we  can  just  go  dollar  sign

2796
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,000
or  we  could  just  go

2797
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
go  in  here  and  add  in

2798
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
a  panel  like  what  we're  doing

2799
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
right  here  you  can  see  how

2800
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
we're  joining  chat  asynchronously

2801
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
so  we  really  could  just  grab

2802
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:53,000
this  section  here  and  just  paste

2803
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
it  right  here

2804
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,000
on  this  guy  like  so  and

2805
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,000
that'll  basically  solve  that  problem  right

2806
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
there  now  technically  this  is  duplicated

2807
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
code  and  that's  probably  not  the

2808
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,000
most  ideal  situation  but  that's  probably

2809
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
okay  for  right  now

2810
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:13,000
and  instead  of  doing  our  chat

2811
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
channel  i  username  what  we  would

2812
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
do  is  we  would  do  something

2813
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:17,000
like

2814
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,000
current  channel  and  then  selected  group

2815
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:26,000
so  selected  group .id  the  current

2816
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
name  would  also

2817
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
be  the  selected  group  id  i

2818
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
guess  we'd  probably  want  to  come

2819
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,000
up  with  a  better  way  maybe

2820
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
we  could  just

2821
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
call  it  current  group  right  instead

2822
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,000
of  the  name  like  so  and

2823
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
then  we  could  probably  come  in

2824
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:40,000
here  and

2825
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,000
list  our  current  channel  as  well

2826
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
and  in  theory  that  would  work

2827
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
so  now  if  we  hit  play

2828
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,000
in  theory  we  would

2829
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,000
have  a  tabular  messaging  system  now

2830
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
we  can  hit  submit  and  there's

2831
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
all  of  our  messages  right  there

2832
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
and  we  have  different  tabs  that

2833
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
we  can  work  with  i  think

2834
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
if  i  do  test  it's  probably

2835
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:00,000
going  to  get  mad

2836
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,000
at  me  invalid  index  id  that

2837
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,000
makes  sense  because  current  channel .id

2838
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
current  channel  is  null  my  guess

2839
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
is  because  i'm  not  in  a

2840
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
channel  yet  so  that  would  make

2841
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
sense  so  what

2842
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
we  would  need  to  do  is

2843
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
we  need  to  make  our  tab

2844
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
container  handle  that  when  the  tab

2845
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,000
gets  switched  which

2846
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
i  think  there  is  a  on

2847
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
tab  changed  right  here  so  we

2848
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
would  have  to  keep  track  of

2849
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
which  index  our  stuff

2850
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
is  actually  located  in  so  i

2851
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
think  that  that's  okay  so  we

2852
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
could  actually  just  do  this  on

2853
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
tab  changed

2854
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
like  so  and  then  we  could

2855
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
just  keep  track  of  what  index

2856
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,000
we're  on  when  the  user  changes

2857
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
their  tab  it  kind

2858
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
keeps  track  of  keeps  track  of

2859
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
that  so  how  i  would  do

2860
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,000
that  is  if  i  go  into

2861
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:53,000
where  the  tabs  are  located

2862
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
so  you  can  see  here  and

2863
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
i  know  this  is  probably  a

2864
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
little  bit  confusing  and  my  apologies

2865
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,000
i'm  just  kind

2866
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
of  working  through  it  with  you

2867
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
guys  but  so  you  can  see

2868
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
right  here  we  have  a  channel

2869
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,000
uh  selected  group  id

2870
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,000
current  channel  so  what  we  could

2871
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
do  is  when  we  do  our

2872
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,000
tab  container  we  could  actually  connect

2873
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
our  um

2874
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
tab  changed  event  and  then  bind

2875
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,000
the  um  user  id  to  it

2876
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
so  we  could  do  is  we

2877
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
could  do  dollar  sign  panel  tab

2878
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
container  dot  add  child  like  so

2879
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:32,000
but  we  could  do  dot  tab

2880
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:38,000
changed  dot  connect  and  then  we

2881
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
can  put  on  tab

2882
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
changed  and  i  guess  i  should

2883
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:46,000
do  on  chat  tab  changed  dot

2884
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,000
bind  and  i  can  pass  in

2885
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:53,000
the  selected  group  id  like  so

2886
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
and  then  we  could  do  that

2887
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:55,000
so  and  then  we  could  come

2888
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,000
in  here  and  just  say  func

2889
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:58,000
on

2890
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
chat  tab  changed  like  so  and

2891
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
then  we  could  pass  in  int

2892
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
tab  comma  or  i  guess  it

2893
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
would  be  i'm  sorry  i'm  trying

2894
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
to  code  in  c  sharp  tab

2895
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,000
colon  int  comma  and  then

2896
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,000
we  could  pass  in  group  id

2897
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:24,000
or  channel  id  like  that  and

2898
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
that  would  pass  in  that  value

2899
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,000
like  that  and  there

2900
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,000
we  go  so  what  that's  going

2901
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
to  do  is  allow  us  to

2902
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:36,000
print  well  uh  tab  comma  channel

2903
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
id  like  that  and  that

2904
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
will  give  us  the  ability  to

2905
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
work  with  this  now  when  we

2906
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
join  a  chat  group  that's  how

2907
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,000
we  have  to  handle

2908
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
that  but  when  we  do  our

2909
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,000
sub  to  friends  channel  we  got

2910
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
to  do  that  as  well  so

2911
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
that  way  we  can  do  it

2912
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:50,000
on

2913
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
both  so  now  if  i  hit

2914
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:54,000
play  in  theory  if  i  do

2915
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,000
submit  it's  mad  at  me  unable

2916
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
to  get  index  id  on  base

2917
01:38:59,000 --> 01:38:59,000
nil

2918
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:02,000
that's  because  selected  group  is  null

2919
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
and  that's  because  i'm  dumb  and

2920
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
i  chose  the  wrong  bind  it's

2921
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:06,000
going

2922
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
to  be  i  dot  user  dot

2923
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
username  so  we'll  grab  that  and

2924
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
paste  it  right  here  let's  try

2925
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,000
that  one  more  time

2926
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,000
so  i'm  going  to  come  in

2927
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
here  i'm  going  to  go  submit

2928
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
and  it  once  again  is  going

2929
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,000
to  be  mad  a

2930
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,000
non -existent  function  bind  on  base

2931
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,000
int  that's  mad  about  let  me

2932
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,000
see  i  think  i  might  have

2933
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,000
figured  it  out

2934
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,000
what  if  i  do  this  instead

2935
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
and  then  i  have  to  go

2936
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
and  find  my  other  bind  which

2937
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
should  be

2938
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,000
i  think  i  need  to  put

2939
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
it  out  inside  the  the

2940
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
signal  connection  so  i'm  connecting  i'm

2941
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
binding  this  to  the  signal  not

2942
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,000
to  the  connection  function

2943
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
i  think  that's  what's  doing  it

2944
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
so  let's  try  that  let's  grab

2945
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
the  other  one  so  you  can

2946
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
see  how  this  one

2947
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:56,000
connect  dot  bind  instead  i  think

2948
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
i  need  to  bind  and  then

2949
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:01,000
do  that  and  then  i  should

2950
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,000
be  able  to  make

2951
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
that  work  and  i  believe  it

2952
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:07,000
is  index  and  then  channel  id

2953
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
so  let's  try  that  let's  see

2954
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,000
what  that  does

2955
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
there  we  go  and  then  if

2956
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
i  click  test  two  it  should

2957
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
have  displayed  test  two  right  there

2958
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,000
so  that's  perfect

2959
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
so  what  that  means  is  that

2960
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:22,000
we  can  go  current  channel  is

2961
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:27,000
equal  to  chat  channels  bracket  bracket

2962
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:32,000
channel  id  like  that  and  then

2963
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,000
what  that  means  is  now  we

2964
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
should  be  able  to  since  we're

2965
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,000
binding  those

2966
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
parameters  i  should  be  able  to

2967
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
send  a  message  and  it  should

2968
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
just  take  it  in  theory  invalid

2969
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
get  text  on

2970
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
null  that's  fine  my  guess  is

2971
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,000
that's  because  chat  text  box  doesn't

2972
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
exist  anymore  because  now  we're

2973
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
going  the  opposite  direction  right  so

2974
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
we're  sending  a  message  if  you

2975
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
see  here  if  you  look  at

2976
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:56,000
the  content

2977
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,000
messages  test  type  is  zero  and

2978
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
if  you  take  a  look  at

2979
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
this  object  it  has  the  channel

2980
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
id  sender  id

2981
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,000
user  id  12  and  then  user

2982
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
name  now  if  we  take  a

2983
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:15,000
look  at  our  channel  objects  right

2984
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
here  so  chat  channels

2985
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,000
you  can  see  test  two  is

2986
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
our  parameter  here  that's  going  to

2987
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
be  our  players  information  if  that

2988
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,000
makes  sense

2989
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,000
so  i  think  we  could  probably

2990
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,000
get  away  with  since  this  is

2991
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,000
going  to  give  us  test  as

2992
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
its  content  and  the

2993
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,000
message  is  going  to  say  sender

2994
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,000
id  is  right  here  the  channel

2995
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
id  is  right  here  i  wonder

2996
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
if  we  should  pull

2997
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
because  it  has  a  username  right

2998
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
here  but  that's  not  going  to

2999
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
hook  us  up  to  our  channel

3000
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
code  so  i'm  curious

3001
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
if  we  need  to  change  how

3002
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
we  send  our  data  across  so

3003
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
we  send  our  data  we're  sending

3004
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
the  message  and

3005
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:02,000
then  the  current  channel  id  okay

3006
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
so  i  think  i  know  what

3007
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
i'm  going  to  do  here  so

3008
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
we're  actually  going  to

3009
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:08,000
change  up  a  little  bit  how

3010
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
we're  doing  this  and  the  reason

3011
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
why  i'll  show  you  if  we

3012
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
take  a  look  at

3013
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
right  here  we're  passing  in  our

3014
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
current  channel  what  i'm  going  to

3015
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,000
do  is  i'm  going  to  come

3016
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:19,000
in  here

3017
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:25,000
and  pass  in  instead  of  just

3018
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,000
a  current  channel  i'm  going  to

3019
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:30,000
pass  in  channel  like  that  colon

3020
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,000
current

3021
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
channel  and  then  i'm  also  going

3022
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000
to  pass  in  a  label  value

3023
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,000
just  so  i  can  have  the

3024
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
label  if  i  need  it  for

3025
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:43,000
whatever  reason  and  the  label  in

3026
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
the  selected  group  id  will  probably

3027
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,000
just  be

3028
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
group  chat  because  it  really  doesn't

3029
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
need  to  have  anything  special  and

3030
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
if  we  go  to  the  other

3031
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:53,000
one

3032
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:57,000
so  channel  chats  we  go  to

3033
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
the  other  one  which  is  right

3034
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:02,000
here  so  this  one  needs  to

3035
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,000
go  dot  channel

3036
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
because  we're  making  that  adjustment  real

3037
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
quick  you  can  see  right  here

3038
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
we're  doing  channel  so  you  can

3039
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:08,000
see

3040
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
we'll  need  to  make  that  adjustment

3041
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
and  then  we'll  just  copy  this

3042
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
guy  right  here  we'll  paste  it

3043
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:14,000
like  so

3044
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
and  then  i'm  going  to  go

3045
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
ahead  and  pass  in  ctrl  x

3046
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
channel  like  that  and  that  will

3047
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
allow  us  to  have  an  object

3048
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,000
that  has  a  label  here  and

3049
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:29,000
then  for  the

3050
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
actual  label  itself  i'll  just  pass

3051
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,000
this  guy  in  like  that  and

3052
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
then  i'll  just  do  channel .id

3053
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,000
like  that  and  then  if  we

3054
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
have  this  then  we  should  be

3055
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:42,000
able  to

3056
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,000
use  this  to  pull  back  that

3057
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
channel  information  instead  and  i  know

3058
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
what  you're  thinking  that

3059
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,000
doesn't  sound  like  it's  going  to

3060
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,000
work  but  it's  probably  not  going

3061
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
to  work  so  let's  go  ahead

3062
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,000
and

3063
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:02,000
say  on  tab  change  bind  selected

3064
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
group  id  if  i  do  on

3065
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,000
tab  changed  bind  channel  id

3066
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:12,000
like  that  and  then  when  we

3067
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:15,000
produce  our  message  here  we're  going

3068
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:18,000
to  be  fetching  back  this  on

3069
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:18,000
channel

3070
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:21,000
message  parse  the  content

3071
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,000
and  right  here  we  will  have

3072
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
a  chat  box  so  you  can

3073
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
see  we  have  chat  chat  box

3074
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
it'll  be  tab

3075
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,000
container  dot  get  node  like  that

3076
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:42,000
content  dot  and  if  we  take

3077
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,000
a  look  at  what  our  message

3078
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,000
is  going  to  be

3079
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
right  here  see  how  we  have

3080
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
our  right  message  asynchronous  we'll  just

3081
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:50,000
say  content  dot  id  like  so

3082
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
and  then  here  we  can  pass

3083
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:56,000
in  quote  id  colon  and  fetch

3084
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,000
back  our  channel  information  so  chat

3085
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
channels

3086
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:05,000
like  so  channel  id  so  it'd

3087
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:10,000
be  current  channel  dot  id  right

3088
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:10,000
here

3089
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
like  that  and  that  will  pass

3090
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
back  our  channel  information  and  then

3091
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,000
from  here  we  could  just  go

3092
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,000
dot

3093
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:19,000
label

3094
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
and  that  should  allow  us  to

3095
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
fetch  back  the  correct  node  and

3096
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
set  the  proper  information  right  there

3097
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:30,000
and  in  theory  that  would  work

3098
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
let's  try  that  and  see  how

3099
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
that  works  so  if  we  hit

3100
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,000
submit  test  to

3101
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
test  send  you'll  see  that  we

3102
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
now  get  our  test  information  so

3103
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:44,000
this  is  a  test  message  like

3104
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,000
that  and  we  click  go

3105
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,000
you'll  see  this  is  a  test

3106
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,000
message  just  like  that  and  that's

3107
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,000
basically  how  we  can  make  a

3108
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
tabbed  system  as

3109
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:55,000
well  that  should  actually  work  for

3110
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:58,000
our  chat  system  so  now  that

3111
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,000
we  have  a  basic  chatting  system

3112
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
that  fully  works

3113
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
let's  talk  about  how  we  can

3114
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
host  this  out  on  the  cloud

3115
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
because  the  best  way  to  get

3116
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,000
your  networking

3117
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
working  is  by  hosting  it  out

3118
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,000
on  the  cloud  that  means  that

3119
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,000
you  have  to  pay  a  server

3120
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
to  host  that  information

3121
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,000
so  if  you  want  a  multiplayer

3122
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
game  you  need  to  actually  pay

3123
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
to  host  that  data  somewhere  right

3124
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:25,000
and  that  is  where  digital  ocean

3125
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:29,000
comes  in  digital  ocean  is  a

3126
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:33,000
pretty  great  tools  kit  that  will

3127
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:33,000
allow

3128
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:36,000
you  to  host  your  projects  right

3129
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
here  on  their  servers  and  it's

3130
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
relatively  cheap  if  you  take  a

3131
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:40,000
look  at  the

3132
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
pricing  you  can  see  they  have

3133
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,000
some  pretty  cheap  droplets  so  if

3134
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
you  wanted  a  cheap  like  five

3135
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,000
dollar

3136
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
server  to  host  your  game  that's

3137
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,000
more  or  less  what  this  is

3138
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,000
for  is  it  allows  you  to

3139
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
actually  host  stuff

3140
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
out  in  the  cloud  for  relatively

3141
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,000
cheap  and  i  will  drop  a

3142
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
link  in  the  description  below  that

3143
01:46:59,000 --> 01:46:59,000
if  you  guys

3144
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
use  it  it  will  give  me

3145
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:02,000
credits  to  be  able  to  host

3146
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
my  own  stuff  now  i  will

3147
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,000
be  hosting  stuff  for

3148
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
this  tutorial  here  i'll  be  giving

3149
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
you  guys  an  ip  address  and

3150
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
you  guys  can  use  it  for

3151
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,000
your  testing  but

3152
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,000
just  know  that  if  you  want

3153
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
to  go  out  into  production  you

3154
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
need  to  use  your  own  server

3155
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
and  something  to  keep  in  mind

3156
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
you  can  host  your  own  server

3157
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:26,000
as  well  locally  but  it's  a

3158
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,000
lot  harder  it's

3159
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,000
not  as  safe  and  people  can

3160
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,000
hack  into  your  networks  and  things

3161
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
like  that  so  it's  really  nice

3162
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:31,000
just  to  use

3163
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
something  like  this  to  host  it

3164
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:36,000
for  you  so  that  you  can

3165
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,000
get  your  game  out  there  and

3166
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,000
get  people  playing

3167
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
it  and  playing  together  so  let's

3168
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
go  ahead  and  create  an  account

3169
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
or  log  in  whichever  one  you

3170
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:44,000
guys

3171
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,000
have  so  i'm  going  to  go

3172
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,000
ahead  and  log  in  real  quick

3173
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:50,000
so  this  is  digital  ocean  and

3174
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
basically  the  nice  thing

3175
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,000
here  is  this  is  your  dashboard

3176
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
right  so  this  is  the  digital

3177
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
ocean  dashboard  so  here  is  where

3178
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:57,000
you  can

3179
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
manage  all  of  your  resources  now

3180
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
you  can  see  up  here  you

3181
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
have  your  profile  information  and  then

3182
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,000
you

3183
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,000
have  whatever  droplets  you  have  now

3184
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:07,000
in  digital  ocean  droplets  are  considered

3185
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
machines  okay  and  you  can

3186
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
see  that  they  have  all  sorts

3187
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,000
of  really  cool  features  here  they

3188
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
have  spaces  which  is  basically  like

3189
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
storage  they  have  database  stuff  so

3190
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,000
if  you  actually  come  in  here

3191
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
you  can  see  that  you  can

3192
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
spin  up  databases

3193
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
right  here  so  if  you're  using

3194
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
nakama  you  can  actually  store  your

3195
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,000
database  outside  of  your  droplet

3196
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,000
and  allow  for  load  balancing  they

3197
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
actually  have  a  full  built -in

3198
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
load  balancing  system  right  here

3199
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
spinning  up  a  load  balance  so

3200
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
you  can  actually  choose  different  data

3201
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:42,000
regions  and  pass  data  in  between

3202
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
different  regions  and  things  like  that

3203
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
by  using  their  load  balancers  now

3204
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
that  being  said  that's  way  beyond

3205
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
the  scope  of  this  tutorial  but

3206
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,000
that's  what  i'm  trying  to  say

3207
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
is  digital  ocean  has  a  bunch

3208
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
of  stuff  for  you  to  use

3209
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
that  can  help  you  get  up

3210
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,000
to  the  point  where  you  can

3211
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:58,000
use  nakama  premium

3212
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
and  actually  have  them  handle  a

3213
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,000
lot  of  that  for  you  but

3214
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:02,000
this  is  a  good  way  to

3215
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:02,000
kind  of

3216
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
get  started  into  that  if  that

3217
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
makes  sense  so  let's  go  ahead

3218
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
and  talk  about  how  to  create

3219
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,000
a  droplet

3220
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:10,000
so  let's  go  up  here  to

3221
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,000
the  upper  right  hand  corner  click

3222
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:15,000
on  create  click  on  droplet  you

3223
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:15,000
could  do  an  app

3224
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
platform  that's  technically  going  to  be

3225
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
cheaper  but  it's  a  lot  harder

3226
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,000
to  get  everything  set  up  properly

3227
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,000
so  i'm  just  going  to  do

3228
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,000
a  droplet  for  right  now

3229
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
and  so  we  can  pick  what

3230
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
region  we  want  our  droplet  in

3231
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:30,000
so  right  here  i'm  going  to

3232
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,000
choose  new  york  new

3233
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,000
york  is  the  closest  to  me

3234
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
so  we'll  choose  that  we'll  come

3235
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
down  here  and  you  could  choose

3236
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:36,000
an  image

3237
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,000
now  if  you  have  a  specific

3238
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
image  that  you're  looking  for  go

3239
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,000
ahead  and  pick  it  right  here

3240
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
in  my  case  i'm  going  to

3241
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,000
go  with  ubuntu  but  if  you

3242
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
want  to  you  can  also  look

3243
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,000
at  the  marketplace  and  you  can

3244
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
pick  different  stuff  so  docker  on

3245
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
ubuntu  probably  would  be  a  good

3246
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:52,000
image  to  get  or  maybe  something

3247
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
like  lamp  if  you're  trying  to

3248
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
do  a  lamp  server  or  wordpress

3249
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,000
or  something  like  that  they  have

3250
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:58,000
so  many

3251
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
different  droplets  that  you  can  actually

3252
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:06,000
use  have  at  your  disposal  you

3253
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:06,000
can  see  here  you  can  also

3254
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,000
do

3255
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,000
custom  images  so  if  you  have

3256
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,000
an  image  you  can  actually  just

3257
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:10,000
spin  it  up  and  have  it

3258
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
work  now  in

3259
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,000
my  case  i'm  going  to  go

3260
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
with  os  ubuntu  we're  going  to

3261
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
start  from  base  even  though  technically

3262
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,000
docker  on

3263
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,000
ubuntu  probably  is  a  better  option

3264
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:24,000
so  i'm  going  to  go  so

3265
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
so  i'm  going  to  go  with

3266
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,000
marketplace  docker  on

3267
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
ubuntu  that's  going  to  save  us

3268
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,000
a  lot  of  trouble  and  get

3269
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,000
it  all  set  up  for  us

3270
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:32,000
right  so  all  we  have  to

3271
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,000
do  is  get  our  docker  composed

3272
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:34,000
and  then  set  up  our  firewall

3273
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,000
rules  and  we'll  be  good  to

3274
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,000
go  so  we'll  go

3275
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
ahead  and  add  that  guy  now

3276
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,000
if  you  come  in  here  you

3277
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
can  see  that  you  have  a

3278
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,000
bunch  of  different

3279
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
options  for  size  now  it  depends

3280
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,000
on  what  you're  trying  to  do

3281
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
and  typically  what  i  tell  people

3282
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
is  you  want  to  pick  the

3283
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:58,000
lowest  value  that  you  can  and

3284
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,000
plus  one

3285
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,000
so  for  instance  if  you  think

3286
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
that  your  game  is  going  to

3287
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,000
be  really  small  and  not  a

3288
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:03,000
lot  of  people

3289
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
are  going  to  play  it  then

3290
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,000
something  like  the  14  a  month

3291
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
one  is  probably  pretty  good  if

3292
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,000
you're  looking

3293
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,000
for  something  really  cheap  just  for

3294
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
testing  if  you  go  to  regular

3295
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
and  you  kick  it  over  you

3296
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:14,000
can  see

3297
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
that  you  can  just  do  something

3298
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,000
like  the  six  dollar  a  month

3299
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
one  or  even  the  four  dollar

3300
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:20,000
a  month  one  if

3301
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
you  can  get  away  with  under

3302
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
10  gigabytes  if  you  were  to

3303
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:25,000
come  up  here  and  choose  os

3304
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
ubuntu  then  you  could

3305
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,000
go  down  to  four  dollars  a

3306
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:32,000
month  at  512  megabytes  now  once

3307
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:35,000
you  get  down  that  low  this

3308
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,000
is  basically  only  used

3309
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
for  testing  you  want  to  have

3310
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:41,000
six  dollars  a  month  a  month

3311
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
one  gigabyte  one  cpu  just  because

3312
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:43,000
it's  going

3313
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
to  allow  you  to  have  a

3314
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:50,000
lot  more  flexibility  for  your  project

3315
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
now  since  i'm  doing  a  marketplace

3316
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,000
image  of

3317
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
and  now  since  this  is  going

3318
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
to  be  a  tutorial  i  should

3319
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
probably  just  do  ubuntu  with  the

3320
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,000
four  because  odds  are

3321
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,000
you're  not  going  to  have  the

3322
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
funding  to  do  this  or  something

3323
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,000
like  that  so  we'll  try  the

3324
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,000
four  we  might

3325
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,000
have  to  upgrade  to  six  we'll

3326
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
see  and  then  you  can  see

3327
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
here  that  you  can  add  a

3328
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,000
volume  which  will  allow

3329
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
you  to  expand  your  disk  space

3330
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,000
now  in  our  case  we  don't

3331
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
need  that  because  it's  fine  for

3332
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,000
right  now  and

3333
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,000
you  can  see  that  we  have

3334
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
authentication  so  we  have  ssh  key

3335
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,000
and  password  now  in  my  case

3336
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,000
we're  just  going  to  do

3337
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,000
so  i'm  going  to  set  my

3338
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,000
password  right  here  and  we'll  scroll

3339
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,000
down  here  and  you  can  see

3340
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
that  we  can

3341
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
do  improve  metrics  and  monitoring  for

3342
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
free  so  may  as  well  turn

3343
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
that  on  and  i  don't  think

3344
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:39,000
we  need  to  do

3345
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:42,000
a  database  cluster  here  but  we

3346
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,000
can  look  at  that  in  the

3347
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
future  so  you  can  see  here

3348
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,000
is  our  host  name

3349
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,000
right  here  which  i'll  call  it

3350
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,000
youtube2  tags  i'm  not  worried  about

3351
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:50,000
it  and  then  you'll  see  that

3352
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:51,000
it  has  a

3353
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
project  right  here  now  this  project

3354
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,000
is  where  it's  going  to  get

3355
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,000
built  under  so  don't  worry  it'll

3356
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:57,000
just

3357
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:58,000
get  built  under  your  account  and

3358
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
then  we'll  click  create  droplet  now

3359
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
this  is  going  to  allow  us

3360
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,000
to  have

3361
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
a  droplet  once  it  gets  built

3362
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:09,000
which  should  be  relatively  quick  there

3363
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:10,000
we  go  you  can  see  it's

3364
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:10,000
in

3365
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,000
the  middle  of  building  it  and

3366
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,000
it  is  now  completed  so  it

3367
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
actually  created  your  little  droplet  right

3368
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:14,000
here

3369
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,000
so  now  at  this  point  once

3370
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,000
we  click  into  it  you  can

3371
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:21,000
see  here  is  our  youtube  2

3372
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,000
droplet  you  can  see  we  have

3373
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:25,000
our  graphs  for  our  bandwidth  cpu

3374
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,000
usage  stuff  like  that  we  have

3375
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
access  which  allows  us  to  adjust

3376
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,000
our  access

3377
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
to  it  we  have  power  which

3378
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,000
allows  you  to  turn  it  off

3379
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
and  on  we  have  volumes  which

3380
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,000
allow  you  to  have  block

3381
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:38,000
storage  resize  which  allows  you  to

3382
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
change  how  big  and  strong  that

3383
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:43,000
droplet  is  so  you're  welcome  to

3384
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,000
go  in  and

3385
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
actually  upgrade  this  later  so  if

3386
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
you  need  that  one  giga  memory

3387
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,000
or  that  one  10  gigabyte  ssd

3388
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:51,000
right

3389
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
that's  all  stuff  that  right  here

3390
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
is  available  and  then  you  can

3391
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,000
come  in  here  and  go  into

3392
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,000
networking  you

3393
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
can  change  your  network  ip  address

3394
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
your  firewall  stuff  you  can  come

3395
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
in  here  and  back  it  up

3396
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:03,000
you  can

3397
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
get  snapshots  of  it  so  that

3398
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:08,000
way  if  you  need  this  droplet

3399
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
to  be  perfect  and  snapshotted  for

3400
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,000
backup  purposes

3401
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
this  is  what  this  is  for

3402
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000
it  allows  you  to  basically  go

3403
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,000
back  to  that  point  in  time

3404
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
and  apply  it  to  your

3405
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,000
image  so  the  nice  thing  is

3406
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
is  if  you  create  snapshots  and

3407
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
your  stuff  gets  hacked  or  something

3408
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,000
like  that  you  can  roll  back

3409
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,000
to  that  snapshot  and  stop  that

3410
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:29,000
hack  from  happening  kernel  is  something

3411
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:29,000
that

3412
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
you're  not  going  to  be  using

3413
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:32,000
but  basically  it  allows  you  to

3414
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:35,000
upgrade  your  linux  kernel  history  is

3415
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:35,000
the

3416
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,000
history  of  it  destroy  allows  you

3417
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
to  destroy  that  droplet  tags  allows

3418
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
you  to  tag  it  and  recovery

3419
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,000
allows  you

3420
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
to  try  to  recover  your  droplet

3421
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
now  that  we've  gone  through  all

3422
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,000
of  this  let's  go  up  to

3423
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
our  console

3424
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,000
here  and  click  on  that  you'll

3425
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,000
see  that  that's  going  to  pop

3426
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:53,000
up  a  droplet  console  now  this

3427
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,000
is  pretty  cool

3428
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
because  you  actually  have  a  full

3429
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
linux  machine  here  so  if  you

3430
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
don't  know  linux  now  is  the

3431
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:00,000
time  to  learn

3432
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
because  linux  is  very  important  to

3433
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,000
know  so  first  things  first  inside

3434
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,000
of  ubuntu  to  install  docker

3435
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
what  you  need  to  do  is

3436
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,000
you  need  to  type

3437
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:18,000
sudo  apt -get  update  and  that's

3438
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
going  to  update  all  of  your

3439
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
mirrors  out  there  and  then  we

3440
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,000
need  to  go  in

3441
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
and  actually  add  the  repository  because

3442
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
docker  doesn't  actually  exist  in  the

3443
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
repo  by  default  so

3444
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:33,000
we'll  say  sudo  apt -get  install

3445
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:39,000
ca -certificates  curl  like  that  and

3446
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,000
that's  going  to  go  ahead  and

3447
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,000
make

3448
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,000
sure  that  we  have  curl  installed

3449
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
and  then  we'll  sudo  install  dash

3450
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:49,000
m  0755  dash  d

3451
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:54,000
slash  etc  slash  apt  slash  apt

3452
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:57,000
slash  key  rings  and  then  we're

3453
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,000
going  to  go  in  and  curl

3454
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
out  to  the  docker

3455
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:04,000
linux  ubuntu  i  will  actually  leave

3456
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
these  commands  in  the  comments  below

3457
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,000
by  the  way  so  you  guys

3458
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:07,000
can  use  it

3459
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
but  sudo  curl

3460
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:16,000
dash  f  s  s  dash  l

3461
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:20,000
f  s  capital  s  l  https

3462
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,000
colon  slash  slash  download  dot  docker

3463
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
dot  com  slash  linux

3464
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:31,000
slash  ubuntu  slash  gpg  dash  o

3465
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:39,000
space  slash  etc  slash  apt  slash

3466
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
key  rings

3467
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:47,000
slash  docker  dot  asc  and  what

3468
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,000
that's  going  to  do  is  it's

3469
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
going  to  actually  create  a  docker

3470
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:53,000
gpg  apt  repo  for

3471
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:54,000
you  so  that  way  you  can

3472
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
actually  go  and  install  docker  and

3473
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
then  we  need  to  allow  access

3474
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:58,000
to  it  so

3475
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:02,000
sudo  ch  mod  a  plus  r

3476
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:07,000
slash  etc  slash  apt  slash  key

3477
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:10,000
rings  docker  asc  and  that  basically

3478
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
allows  us  to

3479
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:16,000
execute  and  use  that  data  that's

3480
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
right  there  so  basically  linux  is

3481
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:18,000
a  permission

3482
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
system  that  is  very  very  aggressive

3483
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,000
so  you  need  to  make  sure

3484
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:26,000
that  you  keep  that  stuff  under

3485
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,000
wraps

3486
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
if  that  makes  sense  so  uh

3487
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
linux  by  default  does  not  give

3488
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:32,000
you  permissions  to  anything  and  you

3489
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,000
have  to

3490
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
give  yourself  permissions  to  it  so

3491
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:36,000
that's  kind  of  what  we're  doing

3492
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
right  here  so  then  we  can

3493
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,000
come  in  here

3494
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,000
and  finally  fire  off  our  apt

3495
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:46,000
resources  now  this  command  is  going

3496
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,000
to  be  really  difficult  to  do

3497
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:48,000
so  we'll  do

3498
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
echo  slash  enter  and  that's  going

3499
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
to  allow  us  to  kind  of

3500
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
get  a  actual  script  going  here

3501
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,000
so  we'll  say

3502
01:57:55,000 --> 01:58:00,000
quote  deb  space  bracket  arch  equals

3503
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:06,000
dollar  sign  dpkg  dash  dash  print

3504
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:10,000
dash  architecture

3505
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
signed  by

3506
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:22,000
equals  slash  etc  slash  apt  slash

3507
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:25,000
key  rings

3508
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:32,000

3509
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:37,000

dot  com  slash  linux  slash  ubuntu

3511
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,000
and  then  we're  going  to  put

3512
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:51,000
that  in  dollar  sign  dot  slash

3513
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,000

3514

dot  slash  etc  slash  os  dash

3515
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:58,000
release  and  we're  going  to  echo

3516
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,000
our  version  code  name

3517
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,000
and  we're  going  to  pull  back

3518
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
the  stable  version  like  that

3519
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,000
we're  going  to  pass  in  a

3520
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,000
pipe  and  we're  going  to  pipe

3521
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:14,000
that  into  sudo  t  slash  etc

3522
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:19,000

3526
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
slash  null  and  i  know  that

3527
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:36,000
that's  a  terrible  command  but  basically

3528
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
all  this  command  is  doing  is

3529
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:38,000
we're

3530
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
going  and  we're  adding  in  we're

3531
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
going  deb  all  of  this  information

3532
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
and  we're  piping  all  this  info

3533
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,000
into  our

3534
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:48,000
sudo  our  sources  list  right  here

3535
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,000
for  docker  and  that's  basically  all

3536
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:52,000
we're  doing  here  i  know  that

3537
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:52,000
it  seems  really

3538
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
confusing  but  that's  basically  what  we're

3539
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
doing  here  now  i'm  going  to

3540
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,000
double  check  this  command  because  i

3541
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:57,000
just

3542
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
spotted  a  mistake  right  here  where

3543
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
i  did  equal  equal  instead  of

3544
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
dash  dash  so  let  me  double

3545
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,000
check  this  command

3546
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,000
and  make  sure  that  i'm  happy

3547
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
with  it  so  we  have  arch

3548
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:10,000
e  dollar  sign  d  package  our

3549
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,000
print  architecture  we're

3550
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
going  to  sign  it  by  our

3551
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
docker  asc  file  and  we're  going

3552
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,000
to  go  out  to  our  docker

3553
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
linux  ubuntu  and  we're

3554
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:21,000
going  to  pull  back  the  os

3555
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:26,000
release  and  i  misspelled  echo  right

3556
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,000
here  you  can  see  i  made

3557
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:28,000
a  mistake

3558
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:29,000
as  always  you  make  a  million

3559
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
mistakes  when  you  do  this  so

3560
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:31,000
echo

3561
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:40,000
so  that's  e -c -h -o

3562
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,000
and  then  we  have  our  version

3563
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
code  name  that  we  are  echoing

3564
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
into  our  release

3565
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
we're  pulling  back  the  stable  edition

3566
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:48,000
we're  going  to  pipe  that  into

3567
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:51,000
sudo  t  right  here  into  our

3568
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:51,000
docker

3569
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
lists  and  we're  greater  than  slash

3570
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:56,000
dev  null  and  we'll  run  that

3571
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:00,000
command  eco  is  not  found  that's

3572
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:00,000
because

3573
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,000
i  spelled  echo  wrong  so  i

3574
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:04,000
guess  it's  good  thing  that  i

3575
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:07,000
that  it  failed  immediately  so  e

3576
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:10,000
-c -h -o  and  we

3577
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,000
will  try  running  it  hopefully  this

3578
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:15,000
doesn't  blow  up  all  right  so

3579
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
we  have  no  such  file  or

3580
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
directory  so

3581
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
all  right  so  i  think  i

3582
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,000
figured  it  out  basically  there  is

3583
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
an  issue  with  the  command  for

3584
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,000
i  think  it

3585
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:28,000
was  this  area  here  so  don't

3586
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:31,000
worry  just  copy  what  i  have

3587
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:32,000
in  my  description  and  just  use

3588
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,000
that  and  it  will

3589
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
just  work  for  you  so  now

3590
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,000
all  i  got  to  do  is

3591
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:41,000
type  sudo  apt  dash  get  update

3592
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,000
like  that  and  that's  going  to

3593
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:45,000
update  all  of  our  packages  in

3594
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,000
our  repo  and  it's  going  to

3595
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
go  and  fetch  out  to  the

3596
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,000
docker  system  and  pull  back

3597
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
the  actual  docker  packages  so  you

3598
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
can  see  right  here  it's  actually

3599
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,000
pulling  down  that  information

3600
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
right  there  and  then  we're  going

3601
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:59,000
to  go  ahead  and  install  docker

3602
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:03,000
so  sudo  apt -get  install  docker

3603
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
-ce

3604
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:09,000
docker -ce -cli

3605
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:19,000
container .io  docker -build -plugin  and

3606
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
finally  the  most  important  one  of

3607
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:25,000
the  group  docker -compose -plugin

3608
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:27,000
and  that's  the  big  one  that's

3609
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
the  one  that's  actually  going  to

3610
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
matter  for  our  project  for  the

3611
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:32,000
most  part  i  mean  the  rest

3612
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,000
of  these  are  obviously  important  docker

3613
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:37,000
-ce  is  the  docker  runtime  docker

3614
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:38,000
-ce -cli

3615
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
is  this  command  line  interface  the

3616
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:43,000
uh  container  is  the  actual  container

3617
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
uh  system  docker  build

3618
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
plugins  is  to  build  your  own

3619
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
docker  containers  and  then  docker  compose

3620
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
allows  you  to  actually  compose

3621
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
dockers  based  off  of  a  docker

3622
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
composition  file  if  you  remember  before

3623
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,000
when  we  talked  about  how  to

3624
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
build  nakama  that  was  one  of

3625
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:59,000
the  big  things  that  you  need

3626
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
to  use  so  we'll  hit  enter

3627
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:01,000
it's  going  to  go

3628
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:02,000
ahead  and  try  to  pull  it

3629
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
it  says  that  it  cannot  locate

3630
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
the  docker  build  plugin  my  guess

3631
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:06,000
is  i  spelled

3632
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:09,000
something  wrong  here  so  let's  see

3633
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:13,000
docker  build  x  plugin  there  we

3634
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
go  hit  go  and  it  should

3635
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:16,000
go  ahead

3636
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:21,000
and  download  and  install  docker  now

3637
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,000
we  might  need  to  upgrade  to

3638
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
the  next  step  up  to  the

3639
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:25,000
one  gigabyte

3640
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:26,000
edition  but  we're  going  to  see

3641
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,000
if  we  can  get  away  with

3642
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
the  four  dollar  a  month  version

3643
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,000
first  and  if  we

3644
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,000
can't  then  we'll  upgrade  to  the

3645
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:34,000
six  dollar  a  month  version  and

3646
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
then  we  can  run  our  docker

3647
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:37,000
setup  here  so

3648
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:38,000
we'll  see  how  this  works  but

3649
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:42,000
we'll  go  from  there  so  it

3650
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,000
looks  like  it  is  running  if

3651
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
we  type  ps  you  will

3652
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
see  that  we  have  a  bash

3653
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
and  ps  running

3654
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
so  if  we  type  docker  is

3655
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
it  going  to  pop  up  and

3656
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:57,000
there  we  go  so  we  do

3657
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
have  docker  running  so  perfect

3658
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
that's  exactly  what  we  want  so

3659
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:04,000
now  from  here  we  need  to

3660
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:07,000
get  a  docker  compose  file  onto

3661
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
here  so  if  we  type  ls

3662
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:10,000
right  here

3663
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,000
you  can  see  that  we  have

3664
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
nothing  going  on  so  what  we

3665
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:16,000
can  do  is  we  can  type

3666
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:20,000
mk  dir  nakama  cd  nakama

3667
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,000
like  that  and  that's  going  to

3668
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:22,000
get  us  into  that  directory  so

3669
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:25,000
mk  dir  makes  the  directory  cd

3670
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:25,000
nakama

3671
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
just  brings  us  into  the  nakama

3672
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:30,000
directory  so  now  we  can  come

3673
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:34,000
in  here  and  basically  compose  our

3674
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:35,000
docker  file

3675
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:38,000
so  if  we're  lucky  we'll  be

3676
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:39,000
able  to  just  copy  and  paste

3677
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
our  composition  file  so  if  we

3678
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:42,000
go  out  here  we

3679
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
go  to  documents  and  we  find

3680
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
our  nakama  instance  i  believe  i

3681
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:50,000
have  a  nakama  server  tutorial  docker

3682
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,000
compose

3683
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
dot  yaml  so  if  we  open

3684
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
this  guy  up  you'll  see  this

3685
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:58,000
is  what  our  docker  compose  file

3686
02:04:58,000 --> 02:04:59,000
looks  like  you  can  see

3687
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:00,000
right  here  this  is  what  it

3688
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:01,000
looks  like  so  if  we  hit

3689
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:04,000
ctrl  a  ctrl  c  and  then

3690
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:07,000
we  go  into  our  web  browser

3691
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:11,000
here  and  we  type  nano  docker

3692
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:17,000
dash  compose  dot  yml  and  then

3693
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:20,000
we  right  click  paste  it  should

3694
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,000
paste  all  that

3695
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
data  right  into  here  so  that

3696
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:24,000
way  we  don't  actually  have  to

3697
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
set  up  filezilla  because  one  of

3698
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:26,000
the  things

3699
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
that's  unfortunate  is  a  lot  of

3700
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:31,000
times  if  you're  doing  godot  networking

3701
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
you  need  to  actually  put

3702
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:36,000
files  up  into  filezilla  and  into

3703
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
the  ftp  and  bring  them  over

3704
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
to  digital  oceans  to  your  digital

3705
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:41,000
ocean

3706
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
droplet  so  thankfully  we  can  just

3707
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:44,000
copy  and  paste  this  and  control

3708
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:47,000
x  y  and  it'll  be  docker

3709
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
compose  dot  yaml

3710
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:52,000
and  now  from  here  we  should

3711
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
be  able  to  just  get  it

3712
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
to  run  if  we're  lucky  so

3713
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:59,000
what  we'll  do  come  in  here

3714
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:03,000
and  type  docker  compose  up  and

3715
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:03,000
you'll  see  it's  going  to  go

3716
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
ahead  and  attempt  to  pull  and

3717
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:06,000
build  our  docker

3718
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:09,000
instance  right  here  now  we  might

3719
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:10,000
run  out  of  ram  it  just

3720
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:13,000
kind  of  depends  but  hopefully  with

3721
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,000
512  megs  of

3722
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,000
ram  it's  going  to  be  really

3723
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,000
tight  i  don't  know  if  this

3724
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
is  going  to  work  we're  probably

3725
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:18,000
going  to  need  a  gig

3726
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
but  we  can  see  so  we'll

3727
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:21,000
let  this  run  and  we'll  attempt

3728
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
to  run  it  and  it  looks

3729
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
like  it  might  have

3730
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
worked  so  what  we  can  do

3731
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
is  if  we  go  out  to

3732
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:33,000
our  youtube  2  we  grab  our

3733
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,000
public  ip  we  go  to  our

3734
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:35,000
nakama

3735
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:38,000
console  and  we  just  put  in

3736
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,000
actually  i'll  just  make  a  new

3737
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:42,000
thing  colon  and  we'll  put  in

3738
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:47,000
7351  so  7351  enter

3739
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,000
does  it  do  anything  that's  the

3740
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:52,000
first  question  it  doesn't  look  like

3741
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
it's  going  to  so  now  we

3742
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:54,000
got  to

3743
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,000
figure  out  is  it  this  guy's

3744
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
fault  it  looks  like  this  is

3745
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:04,000
running  so  my  question  is  server

3746
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:04,000
is  ready

3747
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
to  receive  web  requests  so  it

3748
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
did  spin  up  properly  it  started

3749
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:11,000
the  rule  manager  properly  so  that's

3750
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:12,000
good

3751
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,000
news  oh  you  can  see  it

3752
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:16,000
is  just  absolutely  chugging  though  so

3753
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,000
if  we  take  a  look  at

3754
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
our  youtube  docker

3755
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:22,000
container  let's  see  it  looks  like

3756
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
our  cpu  utilization  is  pretty  high

3757
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
our  disk  io  is  relatively  high

3758
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:26,000
as

3759
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
well  we  probably  need  to  upgrade

3760
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
to  have  one  gig  of  ram

3761
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:34,000
but  at  least  it  is  running

3762
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
so  there  is  that

3763
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:39,000
the  question  is  so  i  was

3764
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:40,000
able  to  get  it  to  stop

3765
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:41,000
so  what  we'll  do  is  we'll

3766
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
close  it  we'll  go  to  our

3767
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
youtube  we'll  go  over  to  upgrade

3768
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
droplet  and  then  we'll  go  ahead

3769
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:48,000
and  just  upgrade  that  up  to

3770
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,000
one  size

3771
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:52,000
larger  to  the  one  gigabyte  edition

3772
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
so  we'll  do  that  and  then

3773
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:58,000
we'll  click  cpu  ram  when  it's

3774
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:58,000
going  to  ask

3775
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:59,000
us  to  turn  off  our  droplet

3776
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
so  we'll  go  up  to  power

3777
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:02,000
we'll  power  it  off  because  there's

3778
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:03,000
nothing  on  here

3779
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,000
anyway  so  we  can  just  power

3780
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
cycle  it  pretty  hard  there  we

3781
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
go  it's  powered  down  we'll  go

3782
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,000
to  resize

3783
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
and  we'll  adjust  it  up  one

3784
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
size  just  to  let  it  be

3785
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
the  proper  size  that  it  needs

3786
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:16,000
to  be  we're  going  to

3787
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:17,000
let  that  run  you'll  see  it's

3788
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:20,000
thinking  about  it  there  we  go

3789
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
and  now  we  got  a  one

3790
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:23,000
size  bigger  droplet

3791
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:25,000
now  we  can  go  ahead  and

3792
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:26,000
power  cycle  that  bad  boy  back

3793
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
on  let's  go  into  our  networking

3794
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,000
let's  come  down

3795
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
to  our  firewall  and  create  a

3796
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
firewall  now  the  firewall  is  just

3797
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
going  to  be  test  firewall  and

3798
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:36,000
what  we'll  do

3799
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,000
is  we'll  have  an  inbound  of

3800
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:40,000
ssh  we're  also  going  to  allow

3801
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:45,000
we're  going  to  allow  a  custom

3802
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
one  and  we're  going  to  allow

3803
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:51,000
for  7351  so  we'll  copy  that

3804
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:52,000
bad  boy

3805
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
and  we'll  go  ahead  and  paste

3806
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
it  like  that  and  then  we'll

3807
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:59,000
do  the  same  thing  for  7350

3808
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:02,000
as  well  and  then

3809
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
we're  going  to  allow  another  one

3810
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
which  is  going  to  be  7351

3811
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:11,000
udp  and  7350  udp  that  way

3812
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,000
we  can  have  all  of

3813
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
our  stuff  all  of  our  ducks

3814
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,000
in  a  row  and  everything  kind

3815
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
of  covered  now  you  can  see

3816
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:17,000
here  all  outbound

3817
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:18,000
is  good  and  we  should  be

3818
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:19,000
good  to  go  so  we'll  go

3819
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:22,000
ahead  and  hit  create  firewall  and

3820
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:23,000
that  should  create

3821
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
that  firewall  onto  that  networking  system

3822
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:26,000
so  if  we  go  to  our

3823
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
droplet  and  we  go  to  youtube

3824
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:29,000
2  you  should  see

3825
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:34,000
right  here  under  our  firewall  networking

3826
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:37,000
no  firewalls  are  applied  to  this

3827
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
droplet  so  i  need  to  apply

3828
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:39,000
this

3829
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
firewall  so  let's  see  if  we

3830
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:44,000
need  droplets  we  can  choose  our

3831
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
droplet  add  droplet  and  then  we

3832
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:47,000
will

3833
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:50,000
search  for  youtube  2  and  we'll

3834
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:51,000
go  ahead  and  connect  it  to

3835
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
that  droplet  so  now  that  should

3836
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:54,000
give  our  droplet

3837
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
the  firewall  it  needs  to  do

3838
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
its  job  so  now  we  should

3839
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:58,000
be  able  to  go  to  console

3840
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
and  fire  that  up

3841
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:06,000
and  then  hit  cd  nakama  and

3842
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:09,000
then  docker  compose  up  and  in

3843
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
theory  it  should  run  a  lot

3844
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:12,000
faster  which  it  is

3845
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:13,000
you  can  see  it's  actually  firing

3846
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
off  just  well  the  init  node

3847
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:18,000
was  successfully  done  cockroach  database  is

3848
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:18,000
up

3849
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
so  now  we're  starting  to  get

3850
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:21,000
the  proper  logs  that  we  expect

3851
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
so  my  guess  is  it  had

3852
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:24,000
something  to  do  with

3853
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:25,000
the  lack  of  ram  that  we

3854
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
had  so  let's  try  that  we'll

3855
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:30,000
refresh  and  there  we  go  so

3856
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:31,000
you  can  see  now  we  have

3857
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:34,000
knock  about  running  out  on  our

3858
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:37,000
website  which  is  one  nine  eight

3859
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:40,000
nine  one  nine  nine  eighty  one

3860
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
one  eight  and  you

3861
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,000
guys  of  course  can  go  to

3862
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
this  and  use  it  so  if

3863
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:48,000
you  type  admin  password  you  can

3864
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:49,000
see  we  have  our  nakama

3865
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:52,000
instance  just  like  before  and  it's

3866
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
exactly  the  same  so  you  guys

3867
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
can  actually  use  this  for  your

3868
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:56,000
own

3869
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
project  providing  that  it  doesn't  get

3870
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:01,000
shut  down  immediately  because  for  some

3871
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:02,000
reason  it  gets  shut

3872
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
down  sometimes  and  that  causes  some

3873
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:08,000
issues  but  that's  how  easy  it

3874
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:09,000
is  to  get  this  to  fire

3875
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:10,000
off  now

3876
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
and  in  order  to  detach  let's

3877
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
hit  ctrl  c  we'll  stop  our

3878
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:17,000
docker  connection  right  here  and  you'll

3879
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:17,000
see  in  a

3880
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
second  it's  going  to  gracefully  stop

3881
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:20,000
so  we'll  give  it  a  minute

3882
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:21,000
to  kill  everything

3883
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:26,000
we'll  hit  docker  compose  up  dash

3884
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:29,000
dash  detach  what  that  should  do

3885
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
is  it  should  allow  us  to

3886
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:32,000
fire  this  up

3887
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
and  be  detached  and  there  you

3888
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:35,000
go  so  now  we're  detached  so

3889
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
if  we  hit  ps  you'll  see

3890
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:38,000
that  it's  not

3891
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
running  but  if  i  come  in

3892
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,000
here  and  i  refresh  you  can

3893
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
see  that  nakama  is  running  if

3894
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
i  close  this  and  i

3895
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:46,000
refresh  you  will  see  that  nakama

3896
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:49,000
is  running  even  though  we  are

3897
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
no  longer  connected  to  our  docker

3898
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:51,000
instance

3899
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:53,000
so  that's  how  we  can  actually

3900
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:56,000
get  that  to  run  without  needing

3901
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:59,000
to  keep  that  window  open  because

3902
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:02,000
if  you

3903
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
is  running  like  that  previously  without

3904
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
running  the  dash  dash  detach  then

3905
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
it  would  have  closed  that

3906
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,000
docker  instance  and  then  your  whole

3907
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
project  would  have  been  gone  so

3908
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
that's  basically  how  that  works

3909
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
so  now  if  we  head  out

3910
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
to  godot  here  we  can  come

3911
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
up  to  here  and  change  this

3912
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:23,000
value  to  our  nakama  instance

3913
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:24,000
so  if  we  come  in  here

3914
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
you  can  see  here  is  our

3915
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:27,000
nakama  instance  right  here  so  we'll

3916
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:28,000
copy  that

3917
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:31,000
we'll  paste  this  like  so  and

3918
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:34,000
then  if  we  hit  play  you

3919
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:37,000
will  see  that  we  can  now

3920
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:41,000
submit  and  log  in  so

3921
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:42,000
you'll  see  that  i  have  logged

3922
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
in  so  now  if  i  take

3923
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,000
a  look  at  my  nakama  instance

3924
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
out  here  on  the  web

3925
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:50,000
if  i  refresh  you'll  see  that

3926
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:51,000
when  we  go  to  accounts  i

3927
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
have  an  account  right  here  just

3928
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
like  as  if  i  was

3929
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:58,000
playing  the  game  locally  so  this

3930
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:59,000
is  how  that  works  and  you

3931
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:00,000
can  come  in  here  and  go

3932
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
test  two  and  you'll

3933
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:05,000
see  that  if  i  click  name

3934
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:08,000
of  match  test  join  create  test

3935
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:11,000
join  create  we  just  joined  our

3936
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:12,000
match  and  then

3937
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
if  the  host  says  start  game

3938
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:17,000
and  then  start  game  you'll  see

3939
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:18,000
that  we  both  started  our  game

3940
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:19,000
now  something

3941
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
here  is  broken  but  i  don't

3942
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:22,000
think  that  that's  a  nakama  issue

3943
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
i  think  that's  just  a  my

3944
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
code  issue  so

3945
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
you  can  see  that  we  are

3946
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
transferring  the  data  as  expected  here

3947
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:33,000
in  our  nakama  instance  so  we

3948
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:33,000
do  have

3949
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:36,000
the  presences  as  expected  but  i

3950
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:39,000
feel  like  something  here  is  wonky

3951
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
a  little  bit  and  i  think

3952
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:41,000
that's  because

3953
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:44,000
i'm  not  in  the  right  scene

3954
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:45,000
to  do  this  i  think  i

3955
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:46,000
have  to  go  to  game  manager

3956
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
dot  tscn  if  you  remember

3957
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
this  is  our  game  manager  here

3958
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:53,000
so  let's  refresh  this  guy  let's

3959
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:54,000
try  re -running  it  so  we'll

3960
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
hit  test  test  to

3961
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:01,000
test  join  create  test  join  create

3962
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:04,000
start  game  start  game  and  you

3963
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:05,000
can  see  that  our  game  is

3964
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:06,000
now  running

3965
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
not  locally  anymore  so  this  will

3966
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
work  with  your  friends  across  the

3967
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:12,000
web  and  what  i'm  going  to

3968
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,000
do

3969
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:13,000
is  i'm  going  to  go  get

3970
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
one  of  my  friends  and  i

3971
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
will  have  him  hold  my  code

3972
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
and  then  he  will  also  do

3973
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:19,000
this

3974
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:20,000
and  i'll  show  you  guys  that

3975
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:21,000
it  does  work  out  on  the

3976
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
internet  so  i  will  be  right

3977
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:23,000
back

3978
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:27,000
okay  and  then  hit  start  game

3979
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:30,000
and  as  you  guys  can  see

3980
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:33,000
right  here  my  friend  and  i

3981
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:34,000
are  both  working

3982
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
together  and  playing  the  same  game

3983
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
at  the  same  time  over  the

3984
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:41,000
internet  using  our  nakama  instance  now

3985
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:42,000
you  can  see  here  that  there

3986
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
is  a  little  bit  of  lag

3987
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:45,000
and  i  think  the  reason  for

3988
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:46,000
that  is  because  we're

3989
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:50,000
flooding  the  actual  nakama  instance  because

3990
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:53,000
it  has  a  bunch  of  data

3991
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
that  it's  passing  through  so  we

3992
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:56,000
should  probably  figure  out  a  better

3993
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
way  to  optimize  this  but  at

3994
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:59,000
least  we  have  it  working  for

3995
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:00,000
now

3996
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
so  at  this  point  we've  gone

3997
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
through  quite  a  few  things  we

3998
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:06,000
talked  about  groups  we  talked  about

3999
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
chatting  and  we  talked  about  how

4000
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
to  get  our  stuff  to  work

4001
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:13,000
out  on  the  internet  for  our

4002
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:14,000
project  and

4003
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
allow  us  to  work  on  multiple

4004
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
